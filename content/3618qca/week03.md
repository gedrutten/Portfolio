## Queensland Childrens Hospital Tour

- Entered the building via Stanley St, next to the Emergency entrance.
- Walked up to the 2nd floor and grouped together between the information desk and the Lego model
    - Lego model is one of 2 models by Brickman (Ryan McNaught)
        - used to help with transition from old hospitals to new hospital
        - used to generate anticipation and excitement
- Photos not appropriate, so notes on observations only
- Stairs clearly visible from foyer, but only seems to be available between 2nd and 3rd floor (escalator to Stanley St entrance as well)
- Observed large meeting room / board room on 3rd floor overlooking foyer on western side of the building
- Met our guide, Lynne Seear (arts-in-health program manager)[Article about Lynne's role and background](https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/lady-cilento-childrens-hospital-artsinhealth-program-is-helping-families-heal/news-story/433f07e22e9319a4d3e159706896a565)


> Whilst in foyer, I overheard this discussion as a family passed through the space...
>
> child: *"I'm scared"*  
> adult male (adult brother / parent): *"Of what?"*  
> child: *"everything"*  
> female adult in group shown away (mother perhaps?)  
> child (panicked) *"They're running away, they're running away!"*  

- Patients want to be considered partners in their treatment (with clinicians)
- opened 2014
- Hard for chronic patients of other existing hospitals (Royal childrens and Mater Childrens) during the transition to Queensland Childrens hospital as the old hospitals were retired.
    - Design considerations put in place to make this transition easier
- While standing in the foyer, I noticed an ambulance parked in the general driveway (Graham St)
- Waiting for news is the most stressful part of a hospital visit for the patients
- Leanne explained that the foyer is meant to be inclusive and not have a stressful feeling - Not a sense of crisis in the foyer.

{{% fontawesome "lightbulb-regular" %}} Colours of counter could be consistent with floor colours to re-enforce the structure and subliminally familiarise the visitor with the architecture.

{{% fontawesome "lightbulb-regular" %}} Lots of nooks and crannies in the main foyer - few clear sight lines becauseof various obstructions.  Perhaps a clearer space would make it feel more inviting and help people to locate where they want to go.

- Intended design is to feel like a tree - main trunk with several branches
    - Trees are universally recognised
    - Are a symbol of shelter

- Central artwork also represents birds in a tree

### Moved to Third floor (outpatient department)
- Lynne noticed a printed A4 poster on the wall, removed it and explained how ad-hoc signage doesn't work and detracts from the important signage.  
- Wayfinding ceiling lights don't seem to point to anything in particular
    - 2nd floor point to exit
    - 3rd floor point to outpatient reception
- There is a school on the same floor as mental health and rehab
    - rehab is designed like a normal house to make people feel like they're at home
- Artwork confirms to the colour palette - Queensland Colour Wheel
- Red is not used as it represents crisis / trauma (although another student made a point that Emergency is Red)
- Art tells stories. eg. parrots "little community" - named from a Germaine Greer quote
    - Several stories are created for each piece so that staff can tell an age appropriate story to keep the children distracted and keep their imagination flowing.
- Consistent bee theme
    - information desk decoration
    - window frosting
    - signage (also the same shape as a stop sign - not sure if this is intentional)
- Vitrines (display boxes) are at childrens eye level
- **While staniding in the main "foyer" of outpatients, a group had been going back and forth to the main reception desk, but weren't served the whole time we were there.** The outpatients department is split into several separate outpatient clinics, however there is a reception desk in the main foyer.  As noted though, this desk did not seem effective.
- 5 large art commissions
- Same amount of money given to Gold Coast hospital ($2 million, although apparently 2.5% of the project funds would normally be assigned to the art budget, this figure is not 2.5%)
- 50% of artwork is indigenous
- There is a piano, but you're not allowed to play it since it's been located next to a noise-sensitive ward
- livewire - older kids engagement program
"Art is privileged" - Lynne
    - Art is not credited on paintings, etc. as the intention is to replicate art in the home.  Odd since art is often seen in public spaces such as cafe's and galleries with the artist name to give them credit for the work they create.
- Thematic wallpaper
- Full-wall murals can lead to hallucinations for kids that are being treated with narcotics.
- Lynne used to work at Qld art gallery
- There is a VR project collaboration with Griffith

#### Other observations
- I couldn't see many maps which I personally found frustrating as I couldn't get a spacial appreciation for the layout
- There is no colour key in the elevator, so once you're in there, if you forget what colour you need, you have no reference point
- When leaving the hospital, I saw the same family that I overheard in the foyer earlier.  It was about 11AM and they'd just walked out of a clinic room on 3rd floor (likely an outpatient room)

### Notes from discussions when we returned to class
- Look up Biofilic Design - designing with an intent to connect to nature.
- Consider all actors with the design
    - Patients
    - Siblings
    - Parents
    - Staff
- Identify design opportunity
- Come up with 3 initial ideas
- Explore different scales
- Mapping the experience
- Spaces or Journey
