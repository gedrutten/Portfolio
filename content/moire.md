### So what is going on here?

This animation is the result of this image

{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-08.png" >}}

and the following image interacting.

{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-07.png" >}}

The first image looks incomprehensible, but it is actually made of 6 frames sliced up and combined to form a single image.  Here are the 6 frames in order.


{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-01.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-02.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-03.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-04.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-05.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-06.png" >}}

When they're combined, you get this image

{{< figure src="/img/3579qca/Pacman-08.png" >}}

So what actually happens is that the overlay covers everything except the narrow stripes from a single frame.  As the overlay moves, each frame is revealed in turn creating the moving image animation.

This kind of animation is often called a [Moiré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moiré_pattern) animation, picketfence or barrier grid animation. What we've put together here is a fairly simple animation to demonstrate the technique.  This same technique could be used to target a specific promotional campaign with imagery that relates to that campaign.  The intention is that by allowing the participant to interact with the piece, it will have more of a memorable impact on them.
