Designed for a friend that enjoys cycling holidays, this tricycle converts to a wheeled suitcase for transit.  When used as a tricycle, the suitcase rests behind the reclined cycling position.  During transit however, the frame of the tricycle envelops the suitcase and creates a trolley for easy manipulation at airports and transit areas.

My role in this project was to model up the 2D designs created by my friend so as to test the geometry, adjust dimensions and angles and design the steering cage.  By creating a 3D model, the functions of the tricycle could be simulated and technical drawings could be provided to the fabricator.  The software used was Autodesk Fusion 360.


The image below shows the trike almost ready for its first test ride.  Several pieces of standard hardware were yet to be attached at this point including the chain, shifters and brakes.  Videos depicting simulations of the folding and steering mechanisms follow.
