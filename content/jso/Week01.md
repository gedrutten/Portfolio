A couple of inspirational images I found in "Sustainable Jewellery" by Julia Manheim.[^Manheim]


{{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_0916.JPG" caption="Cracker Banger Neckpiece, Leonie Philpot, 2006. Cracker Pulls, silver.  Photo: Leonie Phiilpot. (Manheim, Julia. Sustainable Jewellery, p97)" width="45%" >}}

Just like it in general. 

{{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_0917.JPG" class="container" width="50%" caption="Memoria, Editions, ear pieces, Lin Cheung, 1999. 18ct gold, silver. Photo: Lin Cheung (Manheim, Julia. Sustainable Jewellery, p71)" >}}

I like that it appears to be lots of tube cut to form structures.  In fact, it is the clasps from tha back of stud earrings!

This is made out of bamboo (and bone), but I like the idea of using bamboo cut across the axis.

I like the monkeys-fist-knot style clasp

#### Looking through some online videos for kinetic art, I stumbled across these pieces for inspiration:

<div class="row">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_0921.PNG" >}}
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_0922.PNG" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_0923.PNG" >}} 
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_0924.PNG" >}}
    </div>
</div>

I really like the detail of the cage that the device is encapsulated in.  I'd like to see if I can do somthing along these lines as a pendant crystal holder for my niece.  My question regarding this piece is: to make this cage, would you construct it of squared wire with lots of bending and soldering, or would this be a sheet that is cut?  My hunch is that this is squared wire.

The following piece from Viola Halpern is of similar construction

  </div>
</div>

And finally, I love the intracacy of this piece:

## In terms of kinetic art research, these artists came up:

#### Lyman Whitaker
Of these works, I particularly like the tulip shaped vertical windmills as the elegantly match the original form of the tulip even as a still piece.  Many of the other pieces seem to be more abstract than representative of a natural object.

#### Vincent Leroy
I have looked at moire effect before, but only in the context of parrallel lines and the flashing nature you get when 2 grids pass by each other.  I'd like to explore fine wire structures that overlap to create moire effect, or an effect similar to these by Vincent Leroy.

#### Mobiles (the following is by Anne Collette)
