In design, we talk about divergent stages - the times when we are allowing ourselves to explore ideas.  I feel like perhaps I'm in a divergent phase.  I have been working on 2 different things at the moment...

## Spherical Cage Locket

I have spent a heap of time (and wasted a lot of my laboriously squared out wire) trying to figure out angles for this locket.  I have definately made it hard for myself by chosing to do the bars at 60 degrees such that there is 6 bars on each hemisphere.  Ive tried to cut an angle from a half-circle piece of wire, then bend it into that angle to solder.  Once I was successful at this, but normally I end up snapping the hinge.  One in searate pieces, it is a struggle to hold them accurately enough to keep the angles I'm trying to achieve.  Here is some pics of my various attempts to solder 2 quarter-circle wires at 60 degrees to each other.

        I eventually found a piece of steel that I could cleanly bend to 60 degrees and clip the wire to.  Once in place, I could work it as needed so that it could be mounted to the rest of the sphere.

## Fan Blades for Candle Sculpture

I am trying to make fan blades out of brass to test with a candle and see if I can get the same effect as I did with the aluminium one I experimented with a few weeks back.  I decided to use chenier for the axle of the fan with a domed top so that it self-centres into the dome.  I first cut the disc, then domed it... then tried to solder it to the end of the chenier - that proved almost impossible!  eventally I wrapped steel wire around the chenier like a spring, then I slid the tiny disk between the coild of the spring so that it was at the end of the chenier.  This worked great, but when I soldered, I also melted the steel, and I could never be sure that I got it all out, so this piece will never go into the pickle (unless I run a separate pickle).  

Next time I'm just going to solder a larger piece on top and cut it back afterwards!

    </div>

The other challenge I discovered was one as simple as finding the centre of a cirle that's been cut with the fly press.  Since this wasn't created with a compass, there was no easy way to locate the centre point.  I ended up tracing around the circle on a piece of paper and reverting to my high school tech drawing skills to figure out how to find the centre. (I bisected 2 chords and the crossing of those 2 bisection lines is the centre.  I then had to bisect the angles to divide the circle into 8.)  Once i had it on paper, I could transfer the marks back to the disk ready for cutting.
