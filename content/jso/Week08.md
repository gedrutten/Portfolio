In design, we talk about divergent stages - the times when we are allowing ourselves to explore ideas.  I feel like perhaps I'm in a divergent phase.  I have been working on a few different things at the moment...


## Spherical Cage Locket

I have spent a heap of time (and wasted a lot of my laboriously squared out wire) trying to figure out angles for this locket.  I have definately made it hard for myself by chosing to do the bars at 60 degrees such that there is 6 bars on each hemisphere.  Ive tried to cut an angle from a half-circle piece of wire, then bend it into that angle to solder.  Once I was successful at this, but normally I end up snapping the hinge.  One in searate pieces, it is a struggle to hold them accurately enough to keep the angles I'm trying to achieve.  Here is some pics of my various attempts to solder 2 quarter-circle wires at 60 degrees to each other.

        I eventually found a piece of steel that I could cleanly bend to 60 degrees and clip the wire to.  Once in place, I could work it as needed so that it could be mounted to the rest of the sphere.

## Fan Blades for Candle Sculpture

I am trying to make fan blades out of brass to test with a candle and see if I can get the same effect as I did with the aluminium one I experimented with a few weeks back.  I decided to use chenier for the axle of the fan with a domed top so that it self-centres into the dome.  I first cut the disc, then domed it... then tried to solder it to the end of the chenier - that proved almost impossible!  eventally I wrapped steel wire around the chenier like a spring, then I slid the tiny disk between the coild of the spring so that it was at the end of the chenier.  This worked great, but when I soldered, I also melted the steel, and I could never be sure that I got it all out, so this piece will never go into the pickle (unless I run a separate pickle).  

Next time I'm just going to solder a larger piece on top and cut it back afterwards!

The other challenge I discovered was one as simple as finding the centre of a cirle that's been cut with the fly press.  Since this wasn't created with a compass, there was no easy way to locate the centre point.  I ended up tracing around the circle on a piece of paper and reverting to my high school tech drawing skills to figure out how to find the centre. (I bisected 2 chords and the crossing of those 2 bisection lines is the centre.  I then had to bisect the angles to divide the circle into 8.)  Once i had it on paper, I could transfer the marks back to the disk ready for cutting.

## Ideation for the Candle - Fan Design

    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        <strong>Fan peak adornments</strong>
        <p>Some ideas around how to style the top of the fan.  This would also help capture the tiny little brass disc at the top of the chenier that the axle pin goes in.  Could also twist the blade vertically so that it gives a nice effect when looked at from the side - more like an impeller than a fan.</p>

        <strong>Meandering mind</strong>
        <p>What I want to create is a central, vertical cylinder with a pattern of holes in it to project the candlelight.  At the open top end of the cylinder would be the fan blade that is powered by the rising thermals of the candle.  Extending from the fan blade would be straight wire rods that have hooks or rings on the ends.  And from those hooks/rings would hang an ornament that represents the mind - potentially from different cultures or philosophies of thought - the literal western representation of a brain, the yogic representation, buddhist Unalome, and maybe even just a mess of wire?</p>

        <strong>Gears?</strong>
        <p>Thinking about lo-fi gears.  experimenting with different fans is starting to make it apparent that I'm not going to have the driving power to build this idea of having several things hanging around a central vertical cylinder.  Perhaps gears are a solution, but how would I do that using the metalworking skills I've got to date?  Pondering through sketch.</p>

        <strong>Fan Trees</strong>
        <p>Perhaps I could change the idea so that it's not a fan at the top of a cylinder, but more a series of multiple fans in a tree-like structure.  It would play into the idea of repetition a bit more, and having a multiple of simple things can be really beautiful.</p>
