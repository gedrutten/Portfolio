## Volunteered

+ Coordinated booking and participated in collecting and setting up plints for mid-trimester critique
+ Volunteered for pop-up shop on 10th May.  Was briefed on how to lock up, how to use the eftpos, but then the student I was relieving didn't want to leave, so I let her stay and returned to the workshop to continue on my piece.


## Gallery Attendances
+ 7-Mar: Artist space visit and talk to a resident artist - Annerley Rd ([More info](/jso/week02#gallery-opening-jewellery-and-body-space-xiaohui-yang))
+ 8-Mar: Attended Opening - Jewellery and Body Space, Xiaohui Yang ([More info](/jso/week02#artist-space-visit-annerley-rd))
+ 2, 3-Apr: Visited CurioCity - Various interactive sculptures around Brisbane ([More info](/jso/week06#visiting-curiocity))

I generally try to get to most of the galleries that are on around campus, however I dont usually take a lot of photos, so I haven't written about them here.


## Extra-Curricular Jewellery Making
+ Attempted to make a spherical pendant using squared wire.  Found the angles and measurements a real challenge!
+ Made a brooch for mum for Mother's Day.
