## Volunteered

+ Coordinated booking and participated in collecting and setting up plints for mid-trimester critique
+ Volunteered for pop-up shop on 10th May.  Was briefed on how to lock up, how to use the eftpos, but then the student I was relieving didn't want to leave, so I let her stay and returned to the workshop to continue on my piece.


## Gallery Attendances
+ [7-Mar](/jso/week02): Artist space visit and talk to a resident artist - Annerley Rd
+ [8-Mar](/jso/week02): Attended Opening - Jewellery and Body Space, Xiaohui Yang


## Extra-curricular jewellery making
+ Attempted to make a spherical pendant using squared wire.  Found the angles and measurements a real challenge!
+ Made a brooch for mum for Mother's Day.
