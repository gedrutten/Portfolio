## Assessment 3 - Repetition

### Gerard Rutten s486444

This piece addresses the term, _Repetition_ by symbolising the tendancy of us as humans to ruminate over thoughts, having the same thought repeat over and over again as we revisit the past or grow anxious about the future.  It serves as a reminder to focus on the present and not waste our energy thinking repetitive thoughts.

I'm inspired by kinetic art, particularly self-powered kinetic art.  I think its amazing when wind, sun or in this case, heat interact with a piece to bring it to life.  My inspiration comes from artists including Anthony Howe, Lyman Whitaker, Alexander Calder and Reubin Margolin.

Howe and Whitaker are particularly relevant to this piece as they both harness the wind to generate their kinetic motion.

I discovered this thermal effect one evening while experimenting.  I was trying to use the heat from a candle to move water up a coil of chenier similar to the way a solar pool heater works.  I wasn't successful at moving water, but I noticed the updraft and tried to move a fan instead.  Using some sheet aluminium, I created something that worked.

This lead to the idea of repetitive thoughts and the embedding of the rotating fan inside a head form.  The idea behind a partial representation of a head was inspired by an MC Escher image in which the outer skin of the heads are represented by a ribbon.  The ribbon only partially creates the forms, and the viewer's mind fills the gaps between.  I didn't use ribbon, instead opting to go for key panels - the eyes and the back of the head.  I also created a chin, but it didn't _feel_ the same as the rest of the piece, so it wasn't included.  The chin and mouth form are now conveyed with wire.

Working through this idea, I came up with two sketches that I wanted to explore further.  The image on the left works with ribbons like the Escher image, although ribbons in separate rings as opposed to a single long ribbon.  This would be riveted onto a frame mode from strips of brass.  The second image is more of a patchwork that simply suggests the shape of a head and requires the viewer to imagine the remaining elements.

To help create the form, I worked with a digital model of a head and edited it to create the kind of shape I was looking for.  I then ran it through software that sliced it into 4mm slices that could be cut on a laser cutter.  Once the 43 pieces were fixed together, it became a reference form to model against.  I used the various steel forms in the workshop together with the nylon hammers to create the shapes I was looking for, annealing regularly.

    </div>

The kinetic functionality was added with a tealight holder in the base and a vertical axle in the physical location of the mind.  A single wire ring serves to protect the spinning fan and also to help imply the forehead shape.
