So the first critique is complete.  I presented the Bodhi Necklace concept, but now I am thinking of changing my topic.  During the critique, I needed to substantiate my influences for choosing the concept.  At this point I realised that this is not something I feel strongly about and it was simply a creation of things I had heard friends say they wanted.  Although I can substantiate solid foundations for why I came to the concept I did, it doesnt really represent something I am passionate about.

I remembered early in the trimester, when I was looking into Kinetic art and sculpture and how this kind of work really resonated with me.  I remember shying away from it as the complexity of the objects, and hence the skills required seemed daunting, however I believe this is more what I would like to do.

Sitting outside of an evening, I noticed an Ikea outdoor solar lamp I have.  It's just a simple metal tube with a light inside, but the tube is cut with patterns that project a pattern of light.  I started to wonder about creating somthing similar that was lit with a candle - a sheet of brass or copper formed into a tube with holes drilled to create an interesting pattern.  I then started to wonder if I could use the heat of the candle to pump water so that a water feature could become part of this piece.  I ordered some chenier and experimented...

... unsuccessfully.

I had seen something recently that mounted the candle inside a glass tube and had rotary fins at the bottom of the tube to encourage the flame to form a cyclonic shape.  Using some aluminium sheet (from a roll of plumber's flashing), I tried bending together a set of fins in a similar way to manipulate the tealight candle flame.  Again, this was unsuccessful - the tealight just didn't create a flame big enough for the effect to be interesting.

It got me thinking though that there is a significant upward convection of air, so I wondered if I could get a fan to spin above the flame.  Using some copper wire pulled from old power cables, I bent up a frame that could hold something above the candle.  I then cut a circle from the aluminium, cut and bent some fins and punched a hole in the middle.  It wouldn't sit on the wire frame without falling over, so I bent up a tube to act as a sleeve to keep the fan blade relatively horizontal on the vertical wire axis.  Putting  cap on the sleeve prevented the fan blade from dropping too low.  This was successful!

    </div>

I then started to bring back the ideas I'd had earlier of placing a tube around the candle to produce a patterned light effect.  If I then placed the fan on top of the tube, I could combine light and movement.

The idea then of a carousel came to mind - if I placed straight wires on the fan blade extending beyond the vertical tube, I could hang ornaments off them to recreate a classic merry-go-round.  I did some online research and discovered that I was not the first person to come up with this idea and there is a multitude of candle-powered carousels out there.  Nevertheless, I am inclined to continue with this concept at least to see where it takes me.


### Sperical Cage Locket
I finally got around to continuing work on the cage locket.  I used a draw plate to sharpen the square form of the brass wire I'd been working with (previously using the rolling mill to begin the squaring of the 3mm wire).  After that, I annealed the wire again and worked it around a cyclindrical form in a similar way to creating jump rings by clamping it in a vice and winding it around a hardened steel socket. 

Clamping the resulting would wire in the vice, I cut with a saw, but needed to tighten the vice as I went which misaligned all the rings and jammed the saw.  I had at least marked every coil with the saw, but since I had misaligned the cut, I was forced to remove it from the vice and cut each loop individually.

Finding one that was straight enough to create a full ring was a bit of a challenge.  Once I did, I filed the ends to create a matching surface and used steel wire to pull the ends together for soldering.  After soldering though, I noticed the ends had moved slightly and there was a slight shear in the join.  I may have to resolder, or perhaps clean up the joint to be smooth.  This is how I intend to make the locket...

I spotted these images on posters around the workshop.  They reminded of something [I designed in digital jewellery class](/portfolio/digitaljewelery/) that was inspired by the architecture of Santiago Calatrava...

### Visiting CurioCity

I ventured out to look at the exhibits on display for Curiocity exhibition as I realised a lot of these are kinetic or interactive pieces.  These are some of the images I grabbed to remind me of waht I saw

        {{< figure src="/img/jso/WaveOpus.jpg" caption="This piece, called Wave Opus, consisted of a series of vertical pipes.  Periodically a motor would agitate a rope that would flick random pipes and generate a sound.  Interesting and effective concept.">}}
