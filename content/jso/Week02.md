## Class
In class this week, we used the rollers to make impressions on aluminium.  We also used the matrix press to create impressions.  In the image below, I'd used some plastic mesh for the upper left section and some bandage for the effect on the lower right.  The wire in the second image was used in the hydraulic press with urethane spacers to form the bend in the sheet aluminium.

    </div>

We also begain soldering by creating a ring.  Important to get the ends clean (file them flat) and make sure they meet with very little gap between them.  Solder will run into the small gaps and will chase the heat.

Later in the week, I experimented some more with making rings, this time out of brass.  It seems that the cut I made was not parallel as the width of the sheet was quite different where the ends met!

I also started using the rollers to form square wire from round wire.  I was inspired by the structures I saw in my research last week and want to try forming something similar, perhaps just a simple sphere pendant?

## Artist Space Visit (Annerley Rd)

This week, I stopped in at a local shared artist space on Annerley Rd and spoke with one of the artists there.  I found an interesting sculptural piece made from nets recovered from the sea.  In the artist statement, "As they are unattended and roaming they fish indiscriminately, not only catching threatened species but undersized and protected fish as well."  I love the fact that they created art form something so destructive and made a statement about it.  The following piece is called Sword Fish by Steven Kepper:

## Gallery opening - Jewellery and Body Space, Xiaohui Yang

I attended the opening evening of Jewellery and Body Space by Xiaohui Yang.  Seriously impressed by the level of detail.  Is it just my bias, or am I seeing more squared forms?  Many of her pieces aren't made from round wire, but flat, or squared forms.  I'm not sure if they're cut from thick plate, drawn through plates or formed using rollers, but that clean, modern look seems to be something I'm noticing.  She also had cage forms that are also reminiscent of the kinetic art piece I found last week.
