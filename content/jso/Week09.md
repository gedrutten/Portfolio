It's becomming clear that the fan idea wont be powereing anything with any real weight as the brass fans I've been making aren't working even with 3 tealights under them.  I had plans to hang ornaments from rods protruding off the fan blades, but that's not going to be.

What I thought of though is to keep the fan blade idea, maybe even going back to aluminium  as the material, but use it to represent the turning of the mind - so put it inside a sculpture of a head.  Running with this idea, I found a open-source digital 3D model of a head online and manipulated (using meshmixer - had never used it before, but found it pretty good for free software) it to give it the shape I was looking for (removed ears, fixed neck, eyes).  I then passed it through Autodesk's Slicer software to produce a file I could run therough the laser cutter to cut slices of ply that could then be laminated into a head.

        I've noticed this mobile hanging in a postgrad area on level 4 of the Webb Centre for a while now.  I happened to be in there this week, so I took a couple of pics.  Reminds me of Alexxander Calder's work.

        Yet another side project, I decided to try my hand at bending silver wire to make a birthday gift for my dog-loving sister.  I thought they kind of looked like dog paws, and so did she... but a few people I showed didnt think so!  Pretty simple little tings, but my first time making earrings, and first time working with silver.

        I recently wrote about the challenges of finding the centre of a disk that's been cut using the fly press.  When I mentioned this to Liz, she immediately told me about a device they have in the workshop called a circle divider, and here it is.  Such a simple device, on one side it has a right-angled shelf to rest your disk on, then down the middle there is a riler to scribe a line through the centre.  Do this a second time from a different angle and you have your centre.  Simple.

        I came across this piece at the old Queensland Art Gallery.  It's called <i>Orpheus</i> by Barbera Hepworth (1956) and is made from brass and string.  Similar again to the pieces I saw on the workshop walls recently.  I seem to be seeing this kind of structure over and over, so I think I'm meant to do something along these lines.
