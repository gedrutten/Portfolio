## Class

This week we made jump rings.  Pretty cool how easy this is.  A couple of tips; wrap the coil in masking tape to hold it all together when you cut, and use a saw, not a set of side-cutters - that way you get a spare end on the wire and they can meet together cleanly and more securely.  It's far easier to solder flat-ended wire than crimped wire too if you need to,although these chains were not soldered.

When opening a ring, dont stretch it open, twist it so that the circle shape is not disturbed.

## Similar creative exploits outside of class

Although not technically jewellery, there is wire structure involved in this birthday card I made this week.  It's meant to look like a cake with flickering candles on it.

I've often found discrete electronic components to be aesthetically under-appreciated. They have form, colour, and circuit designers often lay out components in an structured way that has a certain appeal.  The entire circuit to drive the flashing LED's for this card is displayed in full glory in an attempt to "decorate" the cake.  The battery is hidden behind the cardboard.
