Looked into kinetic art and kinetic sculpture in the library.  There was 4 physical books, all from the late 20th century, and very worn.  I did come across some good ideas - for instance the Reuleux constand diameter shape - a non-circular form that still tracks a constant width.  Ie. you can use it as a rolling form, but the axis does not remain in the same place.

Although this is an interesting concept, I didn't feel it was something I could incorporate into a piece for this subject.

There was a few ebooks that the library for kinetic art that I still need to look into.

I was also reminded of "Nebula" this week - a piece I was introduced to about 12 months ago.
