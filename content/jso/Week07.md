Looked into kinetic art and kinetic sculpture in the library.  There was 4 physical books, all from the late 20th century, and very worn.  I did come across some good ideas - for instance the Reuleux constand diameter shape - a non-circular form that still tracks a constant width.  Ie. you can use it as a rolling form, but the axis does not remain in the same place.

<div class="row">
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_4083.jpg">}}
    </div>
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_4081.jpg">}}
    </div>
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_4082.jpg">}}
    </div>
</div>

Although this is an interesting concept, I didn't feel it was something I could incorporate into a piece for this subject.

There was a few ebooks that the library for kinetic art that I still need to look into.

I was also reminded of "Nebula" by Reuben Margolin this week - a piece I was introduced to about a year ago.
