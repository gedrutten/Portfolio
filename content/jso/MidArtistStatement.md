## Assessment 1 - Concept statement

### Gerard Rutten s486444

My concept, Bodhi Necklace, explores repetition through the use of repeated elements to create a “fabric” of bodhi leaves that move freely within a tapered structure.  I have chosen Bodhi leaves as they are often linked to Buddhism and spirituality in general and as such are worn by people that wish to be associated with Buddhist philosophy.  It is said that the Buddha achieved enlightenment while sitting under a bodhi tree[^Buddhism].

I intend to arrange several leaves in a few rows to form a tapered shape where each row is overlapped by the previous row as depicted in figure 1.  I envision a chain made from jump rings to link all the leaves together in such a way as to hold the intended row structure.  Skills used include sawing, filing, embossing, bending and hammer-forming.

        Michelle Poirier is a Canadian jewellery artist who specialises in hand made chainmaille and scalemail.  One of her designs incorporates the layered and tapered structure similar to what I’m attempting to do.
