## Workshop time

The making of impressions and chains has inspired me to make a series of Bodhi leaves linked together in a form of scale-mail.  I'm thinking of a necklace that is layered so that there is less leaves on each successive layer as the necklace recedes.

I looked into some books to seek further inspiration and ideas.

        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_4002.jpg">}}
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        I found this image in <i>Jewelry of our time<sup>1</sup></i>.  I like the way the ornaments hang from the main lines of hte necklace.  It seems as if there is actually a "v" on both sides that the bulk of the ornaments hang from.  The "full" effect is what I'd like to achieve with a necklace of my own.

    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        Also from <i>Jewelry of our time<sup>1</sup></i>, perhaps I could do something similar to this  have a central ring tha the leaves protrude from?  I was goin gto run with a necklace, but this is also a potential idea.

    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        From <i>Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective<sup>3</sup></i>.  This is more in line with what I'm thinking - a body of objects, in my case, bodhi leaves, held in some sort of structure by chain.  I was thinking more along the lines of a tapered structure though.

        {{< figure src="/img/jso/IMG_1262.JPG">}}
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        From <i>500 Necklaces<sup>2</sup></i>, this piece by Dina Varano is pretty much the structure I'm thinking, but instead of these cuttlefish shaped forms, I'd like to create the same design with Bodhi leaves. 
    </div>
</div>


In preparation for workshop time, I drew up a shape that represented the bodhi leaf that I would replicate.  I alsotried to make up some forms that I could use in the matrix press to create impressions on the leaf.  I used 2 different gauges of steel wire to build a vein structure.  I tried to solder these together using a propane torch at home, but without any kind of flux, I was unsuccessful.

    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">

    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        Starting to cut - I'm going to get pretty experienced at this!  I've chosen to use copper for this necklace because of the colours it produces and because it's relatively soft.<br><br>
        I attempted to use the wire structure I'd created at home to impression the leaf, but only the larger gauge wire made an impression and the bumps from where I'd wrapped the finer wire around the main wire came through quite clearly - an effect I didn't like.

<div class="row">
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">

    </div>
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        Stage 1 of the press - making an imression with the main spine wire.  I really liked the way the shae came through.  It'd be nice to leave the wire in tehre, actually - I like the contrast.

    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        Second press with the finer wires for the veins.  Using masking tape I was able to keep everything together while I loaded up the press.  
    </div>

Overall, I liked this method of giving the leaves some texture.  I might still work with some roller impressions for a bit more texture yet though as it seems a little bit structured and manufactured at the moment.  Perhaps I could bend the leaves to create a wavy, more natural form.  That might also reduce the manufactured feeling I'm getting from it at the moment.
