In class, I spent the majority of my time finalising the pieces I had so that I could assemble them later in the week.  One issue I had in class was with the chin piece.  It was soldered and three was a small gap between the 2 pieces.  A solution was to fill the gap with a small piece of brass and then later file it off.  Here's is the small piece I inseted.  I later filed it off flush, but the inside portion of the plug was difficult to remove with hand tools perhaps I could have removed it with the hand drills?

I also started trying to figure out how I would lay out the pieces and where I would place the structural pieces.  I taped the sheet pieces to the head mould so that I could experiment with the appearance of different bracing approaches.

I had planned for spending most of Friday in the workshop to finish off my piece, but a group assessment came up and I lost about 4 hours out of the day.  Fortunately a couple of other students wanted to stay back and we worked well into the night to get finished.

Friday was almost entirely assembly and soldering.  I did recreate a larger aluminium fan element as well while I was waiting for the pickle.  I came up with a new wrap plan for the centre tube that allowed the tail of the wrap to double-over the open end of the tube to form the top.  With the brass fans I could solder a cap on the end of the chenier, but that option isnt available with aluminium, nor is there chenier that I could use.  The tube was created by wrapping tightly around a drill bit. The bottom end was cut so that it could be spread out on the underside of the fan to secure the tube to the rest of the fan.

Precarious positioning.  Everything gets harder when it's an odd, and large shape.  It doesn't fit in the pickle anymore either, well, not completely anyway - need to turn it every now and then.  Some of the hardest solder joints though were the underside of the tealight holder.  I tried to have the entire object upsdide down, but the locking tweezers would not reach without being obstructed by something.  Eventually I used some binding wire, but made sure it was completely clear of the solder joints so that it didn't get embedded in the piece - learnt that lesson once already!

As it turned out, I didn't use the chin piece.  It just didn't seem to feel right with the rest of the piece.  I'm not sure if it was because it was 2 pieces soldered together mkaing it different from the simplicity of the other pieces, or if it was just too bold and heavy, or if it interfered with the neck piece too much.  Whatever it was, I just couldn't get it to look right no matter how I placed it, so it got cut frmo the final piece.  Instead, I used a wire to suggest the chin and mouth section - which led to more agonising as to weather I include the lower part of the nose, or let it be inferred by the sheet brass piece.  I went with the inferred.  Its a pity I couldn't use all the parts I'd created, but I'm glad I didn't - it would have been forced.  I like the way it turned out.

        Arrived home and lit a candle to test the final build.  It worked.  So happy it all came together.
