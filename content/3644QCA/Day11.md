We went to the Eurasian Electronics Mall again on the way into campus today.  Given what we'd decided to work on, I developed this shopping list:

+ 9v batteries
+ Battery clips
+ Neopixels
+ Power supply for testing
+ Big fan
+ Little fan
+ Capacitor for back EMF of motors?
+ EL wire
+ EL inverters
+ AA batteries

I brought at least one Arduino-ready MOSFET and relay that we can use to drive the fan if the power consumption is too high for whatever we choose to use.  I also have at least one Arduino and there's the Micro:bits that Paul and Danny brought with them too.  

The 9V batteries and connectors (snaps) are intended to drive the fans.  We figure that a 12V fan should still run on 9V, and if not, perhaps 18V would work.  We're planning on using the fans to activate the ribbons and I'd come up with an idea of a fan guard that we could 3D print and attach the ribbons to.  First we have to determine if it's a viable option though.

We did have some success with getting bits from the shopping list.  Managed to get some switches, a couple of fans, one big, one small, some batteries, some 9V battery connectors and a 12V plugpack power supply.  No neopixels or EL wire.

One idea I had with the fans was to build a trapezoidal base that could be mounted on the garment or to a belt.  On the other end of the trapezoidal shape, we would bolt on the fan, and then have a slotted guard that the ribbon tied to on the other side of the fan.  Something like this next pic.  Note the base is pretty much just a frame so that a decent amount of airflow can get through.

Serious work being done here!  Fans on the other side of the table, One of the cardboard test grills for the fan design next to the green bottle, Arduino and a Neopixel strip for the skull pendant, smaller motors near the blue and gold ribbons.  Its all going on!  

After trying the fans, we decidede that plan wasn't going to work.  

I'd seen an exhibit at the Asia Pacific Triennial last year where they had small vibration motors hanging on long vertical wires and resting on bells and glass electrical insulators - basically anything that'd make a noise when you tap it.  When the vibration motors were turned on, they would bounce uncontrollably and tap on whatever it was they were leaning on.  It seemed like a good use of a tiny motr to achieve an interesting effect.  I wondered if we could do someting similar.  I'd brought a pack of 10 tiny 3V vibration motors, so we glued one to the end of the ribbon and fired it up.  It didn't really work either.  

The we started thinking about putting a transversse shaft on the end of an electric motor and tieing the ribbon on to the outboard end of that.  The hot glue came out again and we got some great effects.  Glueing a ribbon onto a stick of cardboard which is then glued to the end of a vibration motor wasn't the most sturdy design though, but it was a good idea in principal.

And on this table, we had the EL wire running through a dummy piece of card to represent what we're planning to achieve.  

It was looking like we may have to join the EL wire.  We wanted to have the EL wire go around the neckline and around the top and bottom lines of the armbands.  So we needed the EL to have gaps in it.  There's 2 ways to do this; 1. cover the bits you don't want to see with heatshrink, or 2. Cut and connect the EL wire.  The first option is the easiest and most reliable.  We have plenty of heatshrink to do it too.  The problem is that we don't have enough length of EL wire to sacrifice the secitons that don't need to be seen.  The second option is way more risky as the chroma wires in EL are extremely fine and delicate, but if we can't get any more EL wire in Jinan, then option 2 would be our only option.

I'd seen an instructible some time back on joining EL wire, so I looked it up that evening.  They use copper tape to wrap around the inner insulation and solder the fine chroma wires to.  This protects the fine wires as the physical load goes through the copper tape, not the fragile wires.  We didn't have any copper tape though.

        No idea what this structure is, apart from it being interesting.  I'm not even sure if it's finished - is all that framing for some external cladding that's yet to come?  Why is all the ground nearby covered by cloth?  Unfortunately, I took this photo with my point-and-shoot so I don't have a GPS location for it.
