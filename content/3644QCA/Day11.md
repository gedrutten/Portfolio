Went to the electronics market again.  Got some switches, fans, batteries and 9V battery snaps.

Tried fans - didn't really work

Tried working with vibration motors



Thursday 13th

Shopping list
9v batteries
Battery clips
Neopixels
Power supply for testing
Big fan
Little fan
Capacitor for back emf?
EL wire
EL inverters
AA batteries


Googled Joining EL Wire - was sure I'd come across a good instructible once that used copper tape to wrap around the inner insulation and solder the fine chroma wires to.  We didn't have any copper tape though.
