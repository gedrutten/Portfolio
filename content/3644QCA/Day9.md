        Ricco and myself went looking for coffee in the morning before we got picked up by the bus - we found another university near to our accommodation that had coffee, but was pretty impractical since it took so long to get there and back in the morning.  We'll have to survive with the hand pump espresso machine for the next couple of weeks.  Hopefully I don't run out of coffee grounds.

### Introduction to Shandong University of Art and Design

The bus trip was about an hour across to the other campus.  Straight line distance between the 2 campus' is around 21 km, so by the time you take roads, it's probably closer to 30 or 40 km.  

When we arrived at the campus, we were shown to the main conference room - an in-the-round conference room.  Three local classes filed in and filled a quadrant of the room each (we'd already occupied a quadrant).  The basic introductions were done and we were asked about the groups that we'd formed.  We were so happy with the way our group worked from Shanghai that the moment the call went out to choose groups, we elected to stick together.  Each group of 4 from Brisbane would be assigned to a local fashion class to work with since there was 3 classes.  Then within each class, we were to pick a few outfits and work with those specific students to come up with an integrated wearable design.  

We were then let loose to introduce ourselves to our classes and to start discussing ideas.  It went ok.  Some students had pictures of what they were working on and we had a bit of a chance to start discussing ideas.  Language is definitely going to be a barrier again, but we'll have to work through it.  A lot of phone translation is happening and a lot of mistakes, but I'm sure we'll figure something out.  

After the introductions, we were shown around the galleries on campus.

#### Historic display gallery

They had a room that was set up to display the traditional craftsmanship of Shandong.  There was displays for weaving, metalwork, woodwork, textiles, medicines, embroidery and so on.  I would have liked to spend more time in here learning about the history of the area, but we were rushed through pretty quickly.

A mixed group of local and Australian students being shown around.  Note the umbrellas - its pretty hot here.  The local students were doing everything they could to help us feel welcome.  You can see here a couple of the local students were sharing their umbrellas.

#### Workshops

The tour then took us through various workshops like jewellery, metalsmithing, some sort of engraving, sculpture, pottery, dressmaking and of course through their digital fabrication space - 3D printers.  They had a printer there that was about 1.5m high.  At the other end of the scale, they had a couple of high accuracy SLA 3D printers.

After that we went to the 3-story cafeteria.  Again, the locals were extremely helpful.  One woman had heard that I was looking for a coffee and went and found an iced coffee from another floor to give to me.  We ate at a buffet place on the top floor, mostly because they took cash, so it was easier.  I did notice that the same girl who had given me a coffee sat down with us, but didn't eat with us and left soon after we sat.  I later saw her downstairs eating somewhere else.  Could it be that the food on the top floor was too expensive?  The lower floors did have a more "cafeteria" feel to them.  

\

#### After lunch wanderings

After lunch, we had some time to ourselves to look around.  I wandered into an area not far from the cafeteria building and came across a few people who had set up a stand that seemed to be promoting a drawing course.  They offered me their pamphlets (which were more like small paperback books) to keep.  They also had some pretty stunning sketches on display as the following images show.

Lunch wanders - came across a display that seemed to be promoting a sketching course.  

{{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4856.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4856.jpg" >}}
I also came across this outdoor area - I think this is usually a bit busier.  Perhaps it's because we seem to be out-of-term, or perhaps its because it's so hot outside.

{{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4857.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4857.jpg" >}}
This has a bit more life to it.  

\

I also discovered what looked like a public sauna - very popular too.  As I was walking away from it, I was told that it was the public showers - they have no shower facilities in their rooms here, so they need to go and use a shared public shower.  The little toiletry baskets were scattered all over the floor - there was shelves at the wall, but they were full.  Students were tip-toeing through the baskets to get to their own.

### Tech shopping

#### First attempt

We still needed to visit a tech market to get the components we're going to need to make these wearables.  Paul and Danny brought some stuff with them from Australia, and I bought a few things, but both of those supplies were already raided for the Shanghai workshop, and each group is potentially making several pieces here in Jinan.  We're not entirely sure what we're going to be making yet as we've only just met the students that we're working with and only seen maybe one or 2 designs, but the plan was still to stock up - we could always go back to the tech store if we needed something specific.  

In the afternoon, we headed to a tech place that was recommended to us, but we quickly realised that it was a consumer market, and although we might like to grab a few things while we were there, it wasn't the place to buy electronic components.  

<div class="row">
    <div class="7u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4866.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4866.jpg" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="5u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4867.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day09/IMG_4867.jpg" >}}
    </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
    <div class="7u 12u$(medium)">
        Eventually I started asking shop holders about specific components, and I finally came across a shop holder who knew what I was talking about and she gave me a name of a place - The Eurasian Electronics Mall.  She was very helpful and I wanted to thank her somehow, but she had nothing I wanted to buy and I wasn't keen on buying things I don't need.

    </div>
</div>


\

#### Second attempt - Eurasian Electronics Mall

The Eurasian Electronics Mall was pretty much what we were after.  The problem now was that we got there just before closing, so nobody really had any success.  We'll have to return another day.
