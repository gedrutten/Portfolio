Last week for our ribbon design, we were running with the idea of having a stick attached to the end of the motor shaft that would have a ribbon tied to the outer end.  This was generating some really nice patterns.  So on Sunday night after returning from Beijing, I put together a parametric 3D model of a motor attachment that we could print and use.

We ended up going a little more low-tech and using a zip tie around the vibration motor weight.  There seemed to be some problems getting access to the 3D printers, and this seemed reliable enough.  Also, by attaching the zip tie to oppose the weight, the ribbon would counteract the vibration (at least a little).  Here's a test with a zip tie.

### Evening walks up Qianfo Mountain

Ricco and myself decided that there wasn't going to be too many more chances to get to the top of Qianfo Mountain, so we decided tonights the night.  This time instead of meandering around the lowere peaks, we were going to get to the top for sunset nad get some pictures of the city by night.

While at the top of the mountain, we stopped at a kiosk to get some water.  There was no prices, but the vendor was making a hand gesture that I associate with surfie culture - thumb and pinky out, the rest of the fingers curled into the palm.  As it turns out, this is the symbol for 6 in Chinese culture.  I've also come across a gesture in which both pointer fingers are crossed over each other to form an "X" - this is the symbol for 10, which I associated, probably quite incorrectly with the roman numeral X for 10.  Often though, the calculator on my phone comes out to clarify numbers when I'm struggling to understand.

I found this image online that explains the remaining hand gestures.
