I had taken the EL wire home overnight to do the joins, but transporting it back and forth in an incomplete state actually broke most of the chroma wires, so I ended up having to redo most joins anyway.  The magnifying glass came in very useful for this job as I was dealing with super-fine wires and not the best tools for the task.  On top of that - the pressure was on as all of this still had to be attached to the outfit too.

It was a bit of a mad rush to get the final pieces together in time for the show in the afternoon.  Fortunately, the local students came to the party and were great in helping us get the job done in time.

The elation felt by all after a big push to get things done in time.

There was an eery quiet once we were done.  The local students had gone home and our teachers had gone to a dinner.  We considered catching taxi's back into the city for dinner since our bus back to the accommodation wasn't going to come until after the teachers were done with their closing dinner, but for some reason, I felt nostalgic and wanted to eat at the cafeteria.  There had been so many hurdles to overcome and moments of frustration, but also so many achievements.  We had done it.  We had managed to work with the local students and work through all the language barriers and confusion and unfamiliar circumstances to get all 3 pieces across the line.  

We ended up eating some sort of western style food though since we just didn't have the energy to figure out the local food.  I did however discover an oreo milk tea.

### One last collection of random things

{{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day17/IMG_5518.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day17/IMG_5518.jpg" width="100%" >}}
A USB cable used as a cable tie on overhead wires.

Polystyrene transport.

Again... the stairwells on campus seem to be out of the reach of security cameras.

This was our bathroom at the accommodation.  Needless to say, we had to coordinate showering and bathroom duties.  Although, some people did discover that the proximity of toilet and shower allowed one to sit down while showering.  We can't complain though - I think this is considered luxury in terms of student accommodation - after all, we actually _have_ a shared ensuite.  And there's only 2 of us in the room.

### And a walk to the local late night convenience store

Check out the length of ash on this guys cigarette!  Must be a good article he's reading.

A card game that I couldn't figure out.  There was a table for the men, and a separate one for the women.  Playing your card would often be a fairly aggressive move of throwing down the card with significant force.

China's version of a "naked" store, although there's no shortage of plastic bags in this one, so the main goal is somewhat different.

On a side note, Danny told me about Blurb.com today (we were talking about publishing zines) - have to look into this one more when I get home.  It may be a good way to immortalise my old 365 project.
