We arrived to see the vinyl dress ready to go.

EL Wire measurements.  We're just going to have enough EL wire to cover the bits we want to light... if we cut and join it.

        This little connector was a major issue today.  I didn't have any mini-USB cables to program this Arduino mini fr the bulls head ornament.  It was meant to be such a simple build - stuff the head and a short strip of neopixels into the bulls head and have it fade in and out.  But without a way of getting the code onto the Arduino, it just wasn't going to happen.  <br><br>
        I put a call out to see if anyone had the cable, but no luck.  Luckily Paul found one in a shop downstairs, so that got us out of trouble.

Wiring up the ribbon motors and the activation button that will be stitched into the end of the strap.  The idea behind locating the power button at the end of the strap is that when the model grabs the strap, the button will be in easy reach allowing her to activate the piece.  

We also had to come up with a buckle that will allow the far end of the strap to be easily clipped onto the waist.  The main strap - the one with the motors stitched into it - will be attached to the belt at one end and be free to be extended away from the body at the other end.  This "other end" needs to be temporarily attached to the waistband, but allowed to be easily unlatched so that the strap can be extended, giving the motors space to function properly.

Every now and then we should look up - theres sometimes interesting patterns to see.

It seems our idea of creating ribbon patterns with a motor is not completely original.
