        On a walk back in Shanghai, I'd seen timber boards leant up against car wheels.  Later in the same estate we'd seen tyres that had been peed on by a dog or cat.  Today I saw strings tied to the spokes of a car wheel at the lights - wondering if these are linked?  I later saw cardboard resting on the top of another cars tyres.

I've been trying to figure out why the locals cover their hands in what looks like very warm gloves.

        Thigns are done differently here.  In this picture, you can see that there's been a few cables laid after the pavement and manhole were put in place.  In Australia, this wouls need conduit to protect the wires.  Here in China, they've cut a groove in the pavement and placed the wires under a bed of concrete which, as can be seen here, falls apart over time.
