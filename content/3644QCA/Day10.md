First up today we went to our respective classrooms and began working with our groups.  We went around looking at the various designs the students had drawn and were producing.  Our main focus was on supplementing the work they were doing.  I have to admit, it did feel a little arrogant coming in and telling them how we wanted to change their designs - at least that's how it felt, but it seems they weren't too attached to their designs so they were open to our ideas.

We narrowed down our selection to the following 4 designs
<div class="row">
    <div class="3u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4885.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4885.jpg" >}}
        <center>1</center>
    </div>
    <div class="3u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4886.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4886.jpg" >}}
        <center>2</center>
    </div>
    <div class="3u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4887.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4887.jpg" >}}
        <center>3</center>
    </div>
    <div class="3u 12u$(medium)">
        {{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4888.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4888.jpg" >}}
        <center>4</center>
    </div>
</div>

And ended up going with designs 1, 2, and 3.  

{{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4885.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4885.jpg" >}}

This one appealed to us because it was made out of transparent vinyl.  This means it would easily be supplemented with EL lighting or LED's - the plasticy look and feel, the reflectiveness would complement lighting effects.  It's likely that we will go with EL wire (I brought a little bit of white EL), and look to highlight the natural curves of the design.

We liked this design because of all the flowing straps.  We're hoping to create some sort of ribbon twirling feature that can be a discrete ribbon that forms part of the design when not activated, but when activated creates beautiful flowing ribbon patterns.  We're thinking of using fans to activate the ribbons somewhat like the Windform exhibit back at McaM in Shanghai.

This design was our final choice.  We're thinking of integrating lighting to bring out the character of the design.

        I saw this poster in one of the hallways of the building we're working in.  I just thought I'd take a photo of it as it seems to be an example of a product design student's work.

        For lunch today, I decided to figure out the payment system.  So the idea is that you find out how much your item is, then you go to a separate counter and buy a receipt for the amount you need.  They you go back to the retailer and get your food.  Local students have a card to buy their food, so it's a bit more streamlined for them.<br><br>
        I chose the point and pray method of selecting my meal today.  This looked like a delicious pasta, so I happily ordered it.  I didn't notice though that the bowl was set on a bed of chillis in this picture until one of the local students asked me what I'd ordered, then followed up by asking if I like hot food.  She offered to fix my order, but I took a punt on it, and it wasn't too hot, so I dodged a bullet there!

### Tea Ceremony

{{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4893.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day10/IMG_4893.jpg" >}}

In the afternoon, our hosts invited us to a tea ceremony back in the conference room. I didn't get many good photos, but I did take these lessons from the experience...

+ Today's tea ceremony is all about white tea
+ Fujinan province Chen dan dynasty
+ 1000 year history
+ There was a rash that couldn't be treated, then white tea was used to help for medication.
+ 4 places that produce white tea
+ 2 types of white tea, smaller and bigger leaves
+ Silver needle tea is the best
+ There was another shown that was second best (I missed what that was)
+ Show wen 3rd best
+ Fong wen 4th best
+ Silver needle - only the top of the leaf and there is white hair on the leaves giving it a silver look
+ White tea reduces body heat, reduce blood pressure, prevent cancer and anti-oxidant
+ Drink white tea for a cold or infection
+ Tastes better and value higher if it is sun-dried with the natural sunlight
+ Artificial light produces greenish tea, but naturally dried is green-grey
+ In terms of aging:
    + First year tea is naive
    + After 3 years, becomes medicine - good to drink in summer (good to reduce heat and good for bladder)
    + After 7 years very rare, treasure.  Like wine from 1982.
+ Originally lime green tea, but eventually becomes like black tea
+ Stored in dry place low temp, vac sealed so that it doesn't absorb any flavors in the air


### Qianfo Mountain

There is a scenic mountain park a few hundred metres from the accommodation, so when we returned home, Ricco and myself decided to take a walk up there and explore a little.  I figure he'd have better pics than me, but there's a few of my pics from this trip below.  We headed for the big golden Buddha on the left of the map.  I'd estimate the Buddha to be around 20m tall.  It was quiet around the Buddha with only 1 store open, but there was evidence that this is a bustling tourist attraction with children's novelty cars parked up in one area.  After seeing the Buddha we headed pretty much straight up the mountain and found a little pagoda at the top.  A guy was singing his heart out up there and I could hear someone far off in the distance also singing - I guess that's a thing here.  I'm not sure if they were singing to each other, or competing with one another?  We took a random exist from the park on the way back down in an effort to try to find some interesting food (and a bank - I was out of cash again, and a few ATM's I'd visited didn't work with my card).

A building along the path.  It looks like cats are the only residents at this time.

Standing in front of the big Buddha.  A man walks in front for scale.

An image of the wall behind the Buddha.  Notice the amount of carvings here - this is not a short wall.

The pagoda we discovered at the top.

The view of Jinan (and the top of the golden Buddha) from the top.

Trees are overtaking this stone work on the path back down.

### A few random thoughts

        Note the size of these cars.  It is not uncommon to see tiny little cars here in China.  This little red car wouldn't be much more than half the width of a normal car.

        On a walk back when we were in Shanghai, I'd seen timber boards leant up against car wheels.  Later in the same estate we'd seen tyres that had been peed on by a dog or cat.  Today I saw strings tied to the spokes of a car wheel at the lights - wondering if these are linked?  I later saw cardboard resting on the top of another cars tyres.

        Things are done differently here.  In this picture, you can see that there's been a few cables laid after the pavement and manhole were put in place.  In Australia, this would need conduit to protect the wires.  Here in China, they've cut a groove in the pavement and placed the wires under a bed of concrete which, as can be seen here, falls apart over time.
