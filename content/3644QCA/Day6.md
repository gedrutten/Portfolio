Tech markets
Walked back to mall then onto stationary stores, tehn onto old town, ran into Vee, lunch (macdonalds), then into the old town to find teh YuYan gardens, stopped at some beautiful shops, was seen from teahouse, then missed the garden entry (closed).  Tried nearby temple, but also closed.  More shops.  Ate a local deep fried red-bean thingy and squated like a local.  Decided to go to Shanghai Tower for the observation tour.  Got several people on a train over to there, then onto trains home - only a couple then decided to catch a cab from the station.

Sam, Shari, Marlene, Loraine, KJ, Danny and myself.  Ended up getting home about 11:30.  Had rice triangle and iced tea for dinner on the walk from train station to hotel.  A lot was still open despite it being 11pm - in particular, the vegie store.
