Today was supposed to be a day at the tech markets to stock up n supplies for the next stop in our journey.  When we got there though, it was a ghost town - they were all closed.  So the day ended u being another free day.  Basically the group meandered in different directions, but amazing as it is, we continued to run into each other throughout the day.

We wandered around the streets near the tech markets at first, I picked up a few little cruciables that I want to use for aluminium back home - KJ assures me I can melt aluminium in these with a standard blow torch.  Although she did remind me that I need to cure them first with borax.

The majority of us continued on to the mall then onto stationary stores.  In one particular place, there was a bit of a craze on for portable wireless thermal printers and fountain pens.  I resisted the urge to get a thermal printer, but I did get myself a fountain pen.  I haven't filled it yet though - I want to keep the ink in the bottle until I'm done with plane trips, so that's another toy for playing with when I get back home.

I had grabbed KJ for fountain pen advie and we lost the rest of the group.  They were all headed for YuYan gardens anyway, so we headed that way too.  We got to Old Town and were heading for what we thought was the gardens when we ran into Vee going the other direction - she had to eat.  So we ended up in a McDonalds then headed back into od town to find the gardens.  Stopped at some beautiful shops, was seen from teahouse, so we joined that group, but then missed the garden entry - it was closed by the time we got there.  So we tried a nearby temple, but it was also closed.  Did some more shops.  Ate a local deep fried red-bean thingy and squated like a local on the kerb while I ate.  The remaining group - Sam, Shari, Marlene, Loraine, KJ, Danny and myself - then decided to go to Shanghai Tower for the observation tour.  We managed to get all of us on a train over to Shanghai Tower, then onto trains home - only a few of the group then decided to catch a cab back to the hotel from the station.

Ended up getting home about 11:30.  I had a rice triangle and iced tea for dinner on the walk from train station to hotel.  A lot was still open despite it being 11pm - in particular, the veggie store near the hotel that I often see open if I go for a walk before breakfast.

During the day, Lorraine mentioned that she'd been approached by someone with a similar story to the guy that approached Ricco and myself a day earlier.  Perhaps it was a tourist scam... that's fine though, we had a good time :-)

That's the short version... here's the photo version of the day's events...

        Samsung facade - I'd tried to get a decent photo of this the night before, but the light kept blowing out the image.  The reason I wanted to get a picture of it was because of the interesting pattern they'd created simply through distorted circles.

        I came across this display in a clothing store.  It consisted of several strips of white LED's on a fine black frame.  Because the frame was black, you could easily see through it to the products behind it, but when the array was lit with imagery, you also noticed that quite clearly.  The strips were quite thin - maybe 5mm, so very discrete.  It was almost like looking through a set of blinds that were animated with imagery.

We still wanted to get to Yu Gardens, and seemed to be going round incircles trying to find it.  What we did find though were these guys hanging out of this teahouse, so we decided to get in the queue to find our way up there.  Apparently this was the way into the gardens.  BY the time we got through and had our tea, the gardens were closed!

Then there was this particular store that seemed to only stock handmade products.  There was so many beautiful items in here, so I toook plenty of pictures...

        It took some time and a lot of discussion, but eventually as a group we decided to go to the top of Shanghai Tower - the secod highest building in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.  All of us got on to the subway, and managed a connection to find our way to Lujiazui station on the other side of the river from where we'd walk to the tower.  Figured we could find it pretty easily - it kinda stands out.  As it turned out, much of the walk was on elevated walkways, so we didn't even have to battle traffic to get there.  Here's some pics from along the walk to the towers.

        Here's another example of a dynamic advertising display.  Apart from the lit sculpture in the forecourt, there is the actively lit wall behind it.  In tune with the Louis Vuitton style, the wall shimmers with lights like the shimmering of a diamond.  Simple but effective, and in line with the brand.<br><br>
        A close up video of the same wall is shown to the right.

And in the basement of Shanghai tower itself, we glimpsed past this showroom for [Nio](https://www.nio.com/) electric vehicles, a NextEV brand.  Centrestage was the [EP9](https://www.nio.com/ep9), launched in 2016, the goal was to make the worlds fastest electric car.  From their newsroom:  

>"With four high-performance inboard motors and four individual gearboxes, the EP9 delivers 1-MegaWatt of power, equivalent to 1,360PS. The EP9 accelerates from 0-200kph in 7.1 seconds and has a top speed of 313kph. With an interchangeable battery system, the EP9 is designed to be charged in 45 minutes and has a range of 427 kilometres."

Once we got our tickets, we proceeded to the basement and discovered that tere was a long wait as there was a huge queue.  Not only that, there was a second room of queue once we'd gotten through the first.  Amongst the many displays in the basement though was this interesting one shown below.  There is a physical model behind the screens, but the screens themselves have graphics animated on them.  So it's like a computer monitor without the backlight - just the LCD itself.  If they are just the LCD panels without the rest of the assembly, then this presents a really simple way of supplementing a physical exhibit with annotations or animations.

Having assured the group that ther was hardly anybody on the train the night before, I was a little surprised when we were faced with packed trains!  I guess the previous night it wasn't a public holiday.  At least everybody got out ok, although I think a few of the others did catch cabs back to the hotel instead of walking from the station.
