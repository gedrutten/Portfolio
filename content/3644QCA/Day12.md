Mount Tai is one of the 5 sacred mountains of China and has a long cultural history.  There is a spiritual significance to walking up the 7000+ stairs to the top, a journey that can take 6 hours.  Because of the time it might have taken, we went up on the gondola.  Apparently in times passed, the emporer used to be carried to the top.

### Plans for the weekend


On the way back to the accommodation, word got around that a few people were heading to Beijing over the weekend.  I figured this is my chance to catch up with my mate from Brisbane and his family who now live in Beijing, so I got in touch with him and sorted it out.

A group of us then travelled to the train station that evening to sort out the tickets ready for the morning.
