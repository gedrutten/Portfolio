We flew China Southern and already I'm starting to get the idea that the English language isn't going to be that common on this trip.  Being a Chinese airline, the PA announcments are Chinese by default, with broken english as the secondary option - even on the flight from Brisbane.  I guess it makes sense - you'd expect Qantas to make their announcements in English being an Australian airline.  It must feel welcoming to their Chinese guests to sit on a Southern Airlines flight after their holiday abroad and finally hear a familiar voice.  I guess I just figured that Air Traffic control is English internationally, so I assumed that English would be the default language in the passenger area as well.

Our first flight from Brisbane to Guangzhou was delayed and as a result a staff member from China Southern met us as we left the plane to fast-track us through the airport.  She seemed to be in a hurry, so I asked how long we had to get to our next flight and she responded 17 minutes!  This was just after leaving the first plane!  Going from International to Domestic though meant that there was a lot of checkpoints and things that needed to be done before we could get to our next plane.  On top of that, it seems China's domestic flight security is some of the strictest I've come across.  All lithium batteries are inspected, and I lost a pair of small scissors that I had in my pencil case in my carry-on (which had also been in there since Brisbane).  Every person gets a pad down and a run over with the hand-held metal detector.  Since we were a group, we'd tried to stay together as well, so every time one person was stopped or had to go back, the whole group was stopped.  Pretty sure it took us more than the 17 minutes, but we made the next flight and had time to spare - I think that flight too was delayed.  Was pretty stressful for a few of us, but that's travelling, I guess - these things happen.

We eventually landed in Shanghai, but at the domestic airport - and not the main Shanghai airport (Hongqiao instead of Pudong), so our plans to pick up SIM cards for phones was thwarted.  Generally, SIM cards are only available at the International terminal.  So a few of us jumped on the subway to get to the international part of terminal.  Fiona organised the tickets, but Paul came around and said it was something like 16 Yuan, followed by a pause and then, "for all of us".  Thats about $3 for a group of about 6 or 8 people!  I reckon you'd pay that for each person to go from international to domestic airports on the Airtrain in Brisbane!

By the time we got to the international airport though, everything was closed.  So it was into the cabs and off to the hotel for us, sans Chinese SIM cards.  This will mean I only have communication while I'm on Wifi until I can get a local SIM card.  Will have to make sure I'm always with someone with a working SIM.  Some people are using the $5/day roaming option from their Australian carrier (Vodafone, Optus).

        Coming into Guangzhou.  It looks like there's still lots of green space, even though the population is massively higher than Australia.  This photo also has this odd fenced in 'Gated Community'?  Not sure what this is, but there certainly seems to be a significant border wall or something around it.

        Still a lot of green space - a lot of which seems to be agricultural, but also a lot of buildings which seem to be concentrated and multi-level."

        Also coming into Guanzhou.  Mountainous (and quite lush looking) terrain.

I had to take a picture of this, the seating signage for our second flight of the day - seems my name proceeds us (I was in seat 42E)...
