What did we learn?

Looking back on the academic elements of this trip, we certainly got an exposure to Chinese culture.  I'm not sure we learnt a lot in terms of wearable technology though.  In the Shanghai workshop, we were fortunate enough to be exposed to traditional crafts and work within this concept.  Our group was also lucky enough to work with a PhD student that happened to hear of and attend this workshop from a different university (Mengqi Jiang form Xiâ€™an Jiaotong Liverpool University in Suzhou).  Just being exposed to her and hearing about some of the things she's worked with were interesting and opened up avenues to research and explore in terms of what other academeics are doing with wearables.

In Shandong, again, the cultural experience was a strong element of the learning.  Shandong university of art and design went all out on treating us to things like a welcome banquet and providing us a tea ceremony.  The teachers seemed to get more exposure to the culture, having a further tea ceremony and a final dinner which the students were not invited to.  Instead, we were left to have dinner amongst ourselves in the cafeteria as the local students had gone home.  Not the ideal way to end the trip, but just one of the many miscomunications that occurred.  In terms of learning about wearables though, this part of the trip was essentially the same as studying wearables in Australia, just that it was in a different place where we had a multitude of hurdles imposed on us through a lack of common language and difficulties even getting access to technology (both in terms of buying parts to use and in terms of using the facilities on campus).  In retrospect, what we created is pretty amazing considering the circumstances.
