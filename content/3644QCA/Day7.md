As a brief aside, I came across this article in the morning and it became a bit of a topic to ponder.

Orwell’s 1984 was nothing like actual 1984. But it’s exactly like 2019

Existing inside China's surveillance society, it's hard not to think about the fact that you're constantly monitored.  Why did they need our passport and photo to register a SIM card?  What tracking does my phone have now that I've installed and am using WeChat.  Do they know every time I'm on the VPN, and have they implanted cookies that track me even when I'm on that VPN?  What level of monitoring will continue after I return home?  The ability to deliver propaganda that is so well informed to specific targets is quite a powerful tool.  It is a worrying trend, and it seems China is leading the way.


On a lighter note, today we ventured out to visit the McaM - The Ming Contemporary Art Museum.  KJ, Danny, Paul and myself took off on foot thinking we were only a block or 2 from the museum, and by walking we'd see so much more along the journey than if we just jumped in a cab and went directly there.  We seemed to have the address wrong though and we walked a lot longer than expected.  True to form though, we did experience a whole lot more than we would have in a taxi.  Here's just some of it...

        Although I didn't catch it in action on video, the panels in this security gate rotate as the top and bottom booms raise (as in a traditional boom gate) so that when it is vertical, it's narrow (the panels lay flat, vertically), but when it's lowered, it forms a complete wall.

        Power lines... thrown across other lines.  I'm guessing (hoping) these aren't actually power, but some kind of signal wires (eg. internet).

There's a lot of plant life in the water channels.  A lot of them seem to be intentionally put there and I'm wondering if this is an effort to clean the water.  I noticed back at the hotel, there's even a water fountain or 2 in the waterway which I'm assuming is there to aerate the water.

These little scooters looked really fun (not the little fold-up one Paul is playing with).  Brand new, they start at 3999CNY and go up to 7298CNY.  That's about $800AUD up to about $1500AUD for a brand new electric motorcycle capable of travelling at 100km/h.  You're hard pressed to buy an electric assist pushbike for that money in Australia.

### Back on the road

We decided to get a taxi this time to find our way to a shopping mall - one that has a Xiaomi shop.

Paul demonstrating an interactive map in the shopping centre - when the user selects a shop they want to find, the arrows at the top of the pole rotate to point to where you need to go.  

I did make a few purchases at the Mi store.  I finally got around to getting a Mi Band 3, and I got a couple of bluetooth speakers, a battery and an in-ear mono wireless headset.  That last purchase came after I had a video call back home and had to use the wired headphones.  $10 AUD is a cheap price to pay for the convenience of not having to use cables for a clear phone conversation.  

Later that night, a group of us were at the newsagent near the hotel and I'd asked where the notepads were.  Paul replied, "The notepads are over there, just behind the motorbike".  The normality of the statement hit me - we wouldn't normally consider that a motorbike would be parked inside a newsagent next to the notepads, but there it was, and in the space of less than a week, we totally accepted that as normal.
