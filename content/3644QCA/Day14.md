### On Politics

I saw this article in the morning: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/30-years-after-tiananmen-us-doesnt-get-china/591310/

One quote that typifies China's growth from this article is this:

>"Since the Chinese government embarked on its modernization program, in 1978, Beijing has lifted more than 850 million people out of poverty and sustained the fastest economic growth in human history."

This is growth that defies western logic and as the article points out, it leapfrogs other countries that logically should have done better based on the resources available to them.  But the article also talks about how China did that in part by taking advantage of the west...

>"China has used the liberal international order to secure its illiberal political system and create unfair trade advantages for its favored domestic corporations while engaging in intellectual-property theft so massive that, in 2012, General Keith Alexander, then the nation’s top cyberwarrior and director of the National Security Agency, called it 'the greatest transfer of wealth in history.'”

This article goes on to support the idea of America's trade war, or at least the idea of revisiting trade with China, but is concerned that it will be hard to get policy right.  


### Touristing

On a lighter note, Today I was shown around by my friend, Eugene and his family.  It was raining in the morning, so at least it was a bit cooler.  I was a little concerned about Bronwyn and Ricco heading out to The Great Wall, but apparently they had a great time - in fact, the rain and fog added to the experience.

We first headed to Yum Cha at a place just off Wangfujing Street - the main upmarket shopping mall in Beijing.  As it turns out, We were only 2 blocks from Wangfujing Street the day before when we were tired and hungry and looking for something familiar to eat.  If we had've known, we might not have caught a cab to a shopping centre where we had Subway in the food court!

I wasn't able to get a great video of this installation as I'd become "Uncle Ged" and was now attached to a child for the days activities.  Essentially the umbrellas in this feature light within a shopping mall in Wangfujing Street open and close periodically.  It was an example of a simple, yet effective installation that used subtle movement and the power of multiples to create more of an impact.

Some examples of sculpture around Beijing - the first in Wangfujing Street mall, the other on a corporate forecourt.  

After the Wangfujing, we headed south to the Temple of Heaven - a series of spiritual buildings grouped together, the biggest of which is the Hall for the Prayer of Good Harvest, the largest timber building of its type in China.

View from the southern exit of the Temple of Heaven.  There was a single paved path down the centre that was apparently reserved for the Emporer to walk along in the past.  

After this, I headed back to the train station for my return journey.  Since my friend was a local, he was able to order a DiDi for me - similar to an Uber back home.  Unfortunately, like a lot of things, these aren't accessible as a foreigner which makes travel quite difficult.

This is a view of the lines coming from Beijing South (Beijingnan) high-speed rail station.  As you can see, there's a significant number of lines there, and this is just one of the stations in Beijing.  Inside is much like a domestic airport in terms of size and facilities available.  China has invested a lot in this transport option and it seems to have paid off - the fares are economical and the number of people using the trains is high.  It seemed there was all walks of life using the trains, and they're clean and comfortable in economy, so I'd imagine first class is certainly satisfactory for business travel.

Examples of the magnitude of things seen in the landscape during the journey back to Jinan.  On the left, an example of the magnitude of electricity being delivered in this country, on the right, a city in the distance and a greenhouse in the foreground, both huge.

Leaving an interim station on the journey.  Although the train journey was almost 2 hours, we only stopped around 5 times.

Jinan is on a fork of the high-speed rail line with most services only passing through Jinan West (Jinanxi) and then heading south - only the services running east from Jinan go through the Jinan station.  We didn't really check this when booking our tickets, so we all accidentally booked our return fares to Jinanxi, not Jinan.  It was a 30 minute taxi fare from Jinanxi station back to our accommodation.  I have a feeling though that Jinan West is the newer side of the city where more recent development is focussed as the buildings and lights seemed a lot more vibrant and alive.  The pictures above are from the taxi ride back to the accommodation.
