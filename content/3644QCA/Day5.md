Having acquired a SIM card the night before, I recieved a text message to say that I'd used 71Mb of my 100Mb allowance and I had only 29Mb remaining.  On top of the fact that we were led to believe that we had a plan that gave us 1Gb / 1RMB, and that we's spent an extra 84RMB on credit, this was a little surprising.  By our calculations, we should have something like 84Gb of data, not 100Mb!  I spent an hour or so trying to translate the various text messages, setting up the WeChat inquiry account and trying to read the literature using Google translate camera.  Eventually I put a message out to Fiona, and she reiterated that it was 1Gb / 1RMB.  Decided to see what would happen when we got to 0Mb remaining!
        
With this in mind, I set out to use an offline map app on my phone, copying screenshots from the China Lonely Planet eBook I had on my iPad.  I forgot though that it didn't allow importing of files from the photo album, so I had to go through google drive, which meant going through the VPN, then finally I discovered that it wouldn't work with .png files, only .jpg files!  After another frustrating hour or so with tech, I decided to go low tech and see how it went.  Ricco was also keen, so off we went.

Being low tech, I took photos of significant landmarks and maps so that we could always figure out how to get back.  These images are from the train station closest to home.

This was the first China train experience for me (apart from the airport transfer on the first evening which Fiona helped us with), and it was remarkably easy.  The ticket machines had an english option, and the price from Pengpu station (close to the hotel) to the central business district of Shanghai was 4RMB (about $0.80AUD).  I tried to get an English train map at PengPu station, but was unsuccesful.  I later found one in a tourist information centre near the Shanghai TV Tower.  

Our plan for the day was to use the trains as much as possible (We were both sick of cabs already, and trains seemed so easy), with first stop being in the heart of the CBD.  We'd figure out the next stop after that.

    This is the English train map that would stay in my back pocket for the rest of the time in Shanghai.

TODO - talk about where we went, add pics of map

        The image above was one of the large globe's that we could see from the other side of the river yesteday.  If you look closely, you can see that there's 3 people with ropes on the building, presumably cleaning the glass.

        An example of the differences in working conditions here compare to back home.  This is a garden inside a roundabout.  These workers have st up a temporaty bamboo scaffolding to prune the centrepiece of the garden while the city's traffic circles around them.

After the city centre, we jumped on a train again to get to the Old Town - there was a garden in there that was apparently quite nice.  When we got out of the station and on our way into the gardens, we were approached by a guy to take a photo of him in front of one of the buildings - the one with a flower on top.  We struck up a conversation during which the idea of how busy the Old Town was came up.  He told us that he was a businessman in Shanghai for the holiday weekend and had a few hours to kill before catching up with his colleages for dinner.  He'd planned to visit some famous tea house in the area in that time, so he asked if we'd like to join him and we did.

He showed us into the decaying part of the city in the other direction to the Old Town.  He explaiend that many of the buildings there would soon be demolished, and you could tell that many had been abandoned.  It did feel a little bit like a ghost town, and the alleys we did go down that had people in them felt like they were used to having a lot more.  

I did worry a little about our safety, so I had my guard up a little.  We did eventually find ourselves at this little tea shop, went in and were shown to a table with our personal hostess.  

{{< figure src="/img/3644QCA/day05/IMG_4592.jpg" link="/img/3644QCA/day05/IMG_4592.jpg">}} \

At the teahouse, we had:

+ Ginseng oolong (apparently Japanese and Chinese oolong's are different)
+ Jasmine
+ Fruit tea
+ Green tea

We were taught that you hold a tea cup by pinching with the first finger and thumb.  The second finger goes under the cup and the third and 4th are curled under (womens third and fourth stick out).  To drink, you first smell the tea, then you drink it in 3 sips.  

One of the teas was served in a tall cup (well, narrow - about 15mm wide, but 40mm high) and a normal cup was placed over the top.  To drink, we had to perform a series of Tai Chi moves including flipping the cup-on-cup arrangement over so that the tall cup was then inverted inside the normal cup.  After that, we could lift the tall cup and drink from the normal cup.  

Each tea was 48RMB, plus a seat fee of 30RMB came to 222RMB.  She offered to sell us tea to go at $320RMB, but we both passed on it - $60 for tea seemed a bit excessive.  

Later, we did eventually find our way to the Old Town, and our guide was right - it was pretty busy.

        So, Old Town is essentially a collection of older (I'm not sure if they're actually original building or recreations) that are set up as a series of restaraunts ond markets.  At the heart is an indoor market of several rows.  This building to the left is one of the buildings at what feels like the main intersection. 
        </br> 
        </br> 
        What I did find interesting was in the market there was several stalls that had people actually making things right there in front of you.  Selling had become a performance and it seemed to promote the legitimacy of the handmade in these cases.  There's a couple examples of the handmade below.  The guys on the left were making jewellery, the guy on the right was making some sort of noodle, I thinkk.

This is one thing that was quite amazing on the trains - the billboards in the tunnels were electronic.  But rather than display a static image, the images kept up with the train so you saw a "static" advertising animation on the wall even though you were moving.  There must be some sort of speed sensors in place to figure out how fast to scroll the LED's since the wall that the LED's are on and the train with the people that will see the ad are different physical entities.  Thats some pretty wild tech!  

The picture on the right is what seems to be an electronic umbrella rental machine.  You can see the hooked handles protruding from most all but one of the bays.

Later in the evening, I tried to Google the significance of beards in Chinese culture to try to figure out why it was so interesting to them - I didn't really get an answer.
