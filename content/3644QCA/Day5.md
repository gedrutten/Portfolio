Having acquired a SIM card the night before, I recieved a text message to say that I'd used 71Mb of my 100Mb allowance and I had only 29Mb remaining.  On top of the fact that we were led to believe that we had a plan that gave us 1Gb / 1RMB, and that we's spent an extra 84RMB on credit, this was a little surprising.  By our calculations, we should have something like 84Gb of data, not 100Mb!  I spent an hour or so trying to translate the various text messages, setting up the WeChat inquiry account and trying to read the literature using Google translate camera.  Eventually I put a message out to Fiona, and she reiterated that it was 1Gb / 1RMB.  Decided to see what would happen when we got to 0Mb remaining!
        
With this in mind, I set out to use an offline map app on my phone, copying screenshots from the China Lonely PLanet eBook I had.  I forgot though that it didn't allow importing of files from the photo album, so I had to go through google drive, which meant going through the VPN, then finally I discovered that it wouldn't work with .png files, only .jpg files!  After another frustrating hour or so with tech, I decided to go low tech and see how it went.  Ricco was also keen, so off we went.

Being low tech, I took photos of significant landmarks and maps so that we could always figure out how to get back.  These images are from the train station closest to home.

This was the first China train experience for me (apart from the airport transfer on the first evening - which we had Fiona for), and it was remarkably easy.  The ticket machines had an english option, and the price from Pengpu station (close to the hotel) to the central business district of Shanghai was 4RMB (about $0.80AUD).  I tried to get an English train map at PengPu station, but was unsuccesful.  I later found one in a tourist information centre near the Shanghai TV Tower.  


At the teahouse, we had:
Ginseng oolong (apparently Japanese and Chinese oolong's are different)
jasmine
fruit tea
green tea


pinch with the first finger and thumb, second finger under the cup, third and 4th curled under (womens third and fourth stay out)
To drink, you first smell the tea, then you drink it in 3 sips.

1st we just drank as above
one of them was served in a tall cup (well, narrow - about 15mm wide, but 40mm high) and a normal cup was placed over the top.  To drink, we had to perform a series of Tai Chi moves including flipping the cup-on-cup arrangement over so that when the tall cup was then inverted inside the normal cup.

Each tea was 48RMB, plus a seat fee of 30RMB came to 222RMB.  She offered to sell us tea to go at $320RMB, but we both passed on it - $60 for tea seemed a bit excessive at the time.
