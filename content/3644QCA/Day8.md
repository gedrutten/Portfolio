MU2441 | Pudong, Shanghai - Jinan (PVGTNA) | 10:20 | 12:15

Today we left Shanghai, headed for Jinan in Shandong where we'll be spending the rest of the trip.  Here's one last look at traffic in Shanghai, this is from the intersection right outside the hotel as we left in the morning.  After all the troubles we'd been having getting taxi's, thankfully we took a bus to get to the airport.

Before we left the hotel, I happened to notice these rocks in the garden.  Looking closer, there is actually inscriptions in the rocks.  And here I was thinking that the gardens were just there for smokers!

One thing that occurred to me on our trip to the airport - there are no motorbikes on the highway (which is literally a higher road).  I've only seen 2 high-powered motorbikes (thousands of scooters though), and it may have actually been the same one as it looked the same and was seen in the same area.

Traffic does exist in Shanghai.  I guess we were on the outskirts of the city where we were for the week and we never really experienced significant traffic.

What looks liek agreen field project.  This area appeared to be getting rejuvenated into s manicured area ready for development to arrive.  Large freeways and waterways are getting built along with mass plantings.  There were people among the trees apparently maintaining them.

More development.  The number of cranes in operation in China must be staggering.

Not a great photo, but a quick glimpse of the maglev train as it approaches Pudong airport, Shanghai.

The airport terminal has an innovative roof structure similar to a wing.  It's wrapped around a set of almost-vertical compression beams, making the roof and the wire underneath be tension elements, thereby reducing hte weight of those components and allowing for the larger spans of roofline.  The roof inside the building was the same structure, although, possibly an even wider span.

Clear markings on bins.  Shanghai airport bin to the left, Shandong to the right.  I noticed on my phone (I get some Shanghai news delivered as part of my SIM plan) that Shanghai is implementing new rules around recycling.  A few of my assessments at QCA have revolved around problems associated with recycling, so it would be interesting to see how the program pans out in Shanghai.  I noticed that at one stage, I was about to put a bottle in the recycling bin at E. Nanjing Rd and someone came up and took it off me as I threw it in.  I'm guessing it's worth something to them.

### Welcome to Shandong

        Like in Australia, they have a program of painting the traffic light boxes here.  It looks like the paintings were done with very few, very intentional strokes.  It's also a bit odd to see snow capped mountains depicted on the power box when the temperature is actually crazy hot.  I'm guessing perhaps the mountain nearby gets pretty cold in winter.

I also noticed that they use what looks like an IV drip on their plants??

We were treated to a massive lunch and again a massive dinner today.  We were also introduced to the key staff at the University that we'd be working with during our stay.  During the afternoon presentation, it was meantioned that they want to teach us Chinese culture through their food.  

A few facts about the university:

+ They only accept 1600 students from 70,000 applicants
+ They were the only university to run a pavillion at the Shanghai Expo
+ Teachers are encouraged to integrate traditional and modern
+ Expectations for this trip:
    + Wearable design with traditional elements
    + Put into practice
    + Take pictures
    + Create a show / book

As a side note, I read this article on ABC News today about the legacy of Mao and Deng, and how Xi Jinping is running China today.

>Xi upholds Deng's bargain with the Chinese people: we will make you rich, but we will not make you free.
