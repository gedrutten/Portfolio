The waterway (would you call this a river, a creek, a drain??) that passes by the back of the accommodation.  It looks quite nice, but I do wonder what it's origins are.  I also speculate that those water fountains and plants are there to help keep the water relatively healthy.  Theres a nice looking pathway along the other side and I do see some people walking along it from time to time.  

Those power lines look pretty significant too!

        There are flowers along the centre divide of the major roads.  It seems there's a fair bit of pride in keeping up the appearance of the area.

        This guy has furniture on the back of his 3-wheeled bike.  It sees to be electric too - he's got his feet up!  Almost all the bicycles are electric here.  So much more advanced in that regard than Australia.

Above: A couple of images of an interesting piece that explores the brush stroke.  I found this particularly interesting since it's quite a simple thing, the brush stroke, but also incredible complex concept.  The separate image to the right just caught my attention.

Below is a couple of examples of sculpture work also being exhibited at the graduate show.  The item on the left stood about 1.5m tall.

Then there was this random car parked outside one of the corridors.  

Below is some examples of jewellery that was being set up for display.

This glass work was amazing - although the images are poor, the glass work itself was very geometric and looked to consist of some very accurate cutting / grinding such that the pieces fit together perfectly.

The jewellery workshops were not too dissimilar to those back home... albeit a lot busier - it seems a student gets their own desk here that they can call home.  They seem to use a bucket of rock-like balls instead of fire bricks too.  And that orange thing - that's an induction powered furnace.  Good kit!  

The rest of these images are mostly of posters on the walls.  I took these as they show a number of the works that have been created in these studios in a condensed form.  I feel like I could look at them several times and discover something new each time.

And finally is this image which I was amazed at the detail.  I translated the explanation out of curiosity - sounds like the image is the result of quite a journey by the artist.

Early Spring  
Paper Colouring | 108 x 153cm  
Instructor: Tang Zheming  

_"The picture depicts the scene of the mountain that is coming in the early spring: winter is coming to spring, the earth is recovering, and the mountains are floating. Moving a faint mist, the message of spring is heard. In the distance, the peaks are towering, the imposing majesty is close to the garden, and the mountains and rocks are abrupt; the mountains and springs are plunging down, the river is in the valley, and the bridges and towers are hidden among the trees. At the water's edge, people in the mountains have added unlimited vitality to nature. The mountains and rocks are characterized by trees, or straight or with a sparse or different posture. Under the tree, the pen is flexible, the tree is multi-worm, and there are many branches like claws and crab claws on the branches._  

_Impressions of homework: I have been painting for more than three weeks in this early spring. I have been groping all the way, and I have walked a lot of bends. I really feel that I really have to write about the ancient paintings. Before I painted the landscape, I painted most of them. Linhua this Northern Song Dynasty is the first time. Fuchun Mountain Residence, which is a land of Huanggongwang, feels easy, but in the face of such a huge system, I donâ€™t know where to write it. It is the first to brush the ink according to the number of the four kings, or the yellow public media said that the landscape is light ink. After the rice knows that the Song painting is actually like a sketch, from the fade to the deep, first use a light storm to play an uncertain type, and then continue to increase the ink to determine the shape, and finally dye. I was anxious to draw first, in order to produce an effect, I rushed to heavy ink, and later I wanted to adjust and regret it. Fortunately, I found the problem in time, and tried to make up for it. The situation was completely panic after I missed it in control. This early spring picture is very classic. I will come back again and savor the ancients. The Song Dynasty is the highest and the purest, and it is all about the best performance. This is the most essential thing of Chinese culture._  

_The teacher's comment on the work, originally as Guo Xiong's "Early Spring Picture" sales, this time to familiarize with the grass is difficult, even because of the changes in materials in the pen and ink language to re-adapt and adjust the author's attitude is extremely serious, every detail The copy is not out of shape, the mouth, the pine needle, the cirrus. The contours of the outer body of the mountain are very durable, especially for the authors who use the pen to have strong self-confidence, showing the skill of driving the brush and the anxiety of learning traditional culture."_



## Workshop at PACC

After the tour of the university, we were taken to Gucun Park, a surprisingly spacious and green space with a lake in the middle.  It's quite amazing really that in a major city like Shanghai, you could have this large and lush parkland.  Even more interesting was the fact that there seemed to be hardly anybody else around.  Here's some photos of the space that we would be working over the next couple of days.  The building we are working in is on the lake.

After lunch, we were briefed on the plan for the next couple of days and were introduced to Yanxi Shen, an Intangible Cultural Heritage representative of the Yao people.  She presented a series of embroidered works and explained the significance of embroidery to the women of her culture.  It is their form of communication as they Yao people have no written communication.  As such, they tell their stories through their embroidery, mostly in black and white.  The vibrantly coloured garments are also hand embroidered, but it is the black and white garments, usually worn as an underskirt that tell their stories.

When the Yao women are bored or lonely, they would sing while they embroidered, attracting company to visit.  And once they have children of their own, they begin to embroider for those children - for their daughters, and for their future daughter-in-laws.  Yanxi gave us the pleasure of singing a traditional song as she embroidered which you can see below...

I reflected a little on the fact that the message was in black and white and related it to our own written language.  We write in black and white, or at least traditionally we did, and even today it is advised to use contrasting colours for text.  It is interesting that the Yao women also used black and white - it is simple and gets the message across without distraction. Could you imagine how difficult it would be to read multi-couloured text.  I think, by reducing the palette to 2 colours, they tell a clearer story.  And by making their outer garments so vibrantly colourful, they emphasise the monochrome message.


### Close up images of embroidery

You can see in these images and the following video that there is actually several different types of stitching being used, not just simple cross-stitching.

After the demonstration, we were tasked with coming up with individual ideas of how we might interpret their traditions through wearable tech.  After presenting our ideas to the group, we tried to align ourselves with people having similar ideas.

My idea was a way of telling stories through something similar to an LCD.  Not quite tele-tubbies, more e-ink - essentially a lo-fi slow-to-update monochrome display that could convey a story in a similar way to the cross stitch embroidery.  We were then tasked with grouping up with people that had similar ideas - with the condition that the groups must be a mix of Australian and local students.  Ricco and myself paired up and tried to find a local student with a similar idea.  We identified one lady with a similar idea, but couldn't form a complete group.  Eventually we found ourselves as the odd group and were split - myself and Ricco joined one group while the local student joined a different group.  As it turned out, our ideas were still quite similar to the group we joined, so the fit seemed pretty good.

Our group is: KJ, Vee, Ricco, Mengqi Jiang (who mentioned when she introduced herself that she works with smart textiles), Jingxian Zhao and myself.

Evening Meanderings
---

A group of us walked to a nearby (still took at least 40 minutes to walk there) shopping mall to get some dinner.  


I took these pics on the way.  The wavy lights were simply the decoration on what looked like an office building.  They were actually just single lights at the bottom of vertically aligned wing-shaped aluminium uprights that provided the reflection, and much of the lighting effect.  The was also a couple of police officers in the grounds of the buildings that had little LED red-and-blue flashing lights on their shoulders - there's a wearable!  I didn't take a photo... didn't think that would be a good idea.  I have noticed actually that it's common for a police vehicle to have their lights flashing for no apparent reason.  I guess they're not used in the same way here as back home.

The box of white lights was actually a hanging display inside the shopping centre.  Each box was only about 40cm wide and the small white dots are LED's.

Dinner was a mission.  We were a large group, so it was difficult to get a consensus on where to eat.  Eventually a small group splintered off and went to get some KFC.  I stayed with the group that wanted to eat local food.  We ended up in a hot pot restaurant, but there was no staff that could speak english and a few of us had some specific dietary needs.  It took well over an hour to order, and at one stage, they had recruited a staff member from a nearby UniQlo store to help with the translation.  Eventually, one of us used WeChat to communicate with the staff as it has an inbuilt translation feature.  I still don't have a sim card, so I couldn't help out with this - its amazing how lost you can feel not having access to the tools we tend to use everyday.

We tried to tip them when we paid the bill, but they wouldn't take it.  The tip ended up paying for our cab rides home.

Apparently the KFC was delicious too - they give you some sort of Portugese tart with your meal.
