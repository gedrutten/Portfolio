## Theories
This lecture covered a variety of topics related to filmmaking as a design process.  A couple of philosophical concepts related to communication were covered - "The death of the author" by Roland Bathes and the concept of the Rhizome by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.  This was interleaved with practical concepts and techniques used in filmmaking to effectively deliver a message - a way of designing to communicate.

### The Death of the Author - Roland Bathes
By leveraging and understanding the ideas presented by Roland Bathes, we can put ourselves in an empathetic situation of the viewer and how they will interpret our work.  Bathes' essay "The Death of the author"[^DeathOfAuthor] leads by discussing the classical way of interpreting writings is with the persona of the author in mind:

> "The explanation of a work is always sought in the man or woman who produced it, as if it were always in the end, through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction, the voice of a single person, the author ‘confiding’ in us."

Through discussion and analysis of contemporary writing, he goes on to discuss the idea that everything that is created is simply a composition of things that have already been created - A book is simply an arrangement of words from the dictionary for example.  The words already existed, the writer simply brings them together.  Finally, in closing he postulates that the author

> "Thus is revealed the total existence of writing: a text is made of multiple writings, drawn from many cultures and entering into mutual relations of dialogue, parody, contestation, **but there is one place where this multiplicity is focused and that place is the reader, not, as was hitherto said, the author**. The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost; a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination."   

(emphasis added)

### The Rhizome - Deleuze and Guattari

The rhizome is actually a metaphor, derived from the botanic description of a plant stem that shoots out roots and stems from nodes; one that can create a new plant from separated pieces.[^RhizomeDef]

_Comparison of tree vs rhizome[^RhizomeImage].  Note that the tree has a central trunk that everything grows from in a hierarchical manner, whereas the rhizome has no central trunk - each part can grow roots and branches from its nodes._


Deleuze and Guitarri use the term Rhizome to describe an unordered, non-hierarchical way of thinking.  Traditionally we thing of thought in a structured tree-like form with a central node that has branching offshoots.  A rhizome is different in that there is no central node that everything comes from, or rather _everything is the central node_ and any part can come from any other part.  

There are 6 principles to a rhizome:

1. Connection
2. Heterogeneity  
    These 2 mean that any point of the rhizome can be connected to any other.  It is non-hierarchical.
3. Multiplicity
    There is no central point or structure
4. Asignifying rupture
    When cut or broken, it will continue to grow
5. Cartography
6. Decalcomania
    These 2 points mean that there is no master plan, but the reslt can be mapped.
    
If you make a comparison of website structure, Wikipedia is a site that allows you to jump from one topic to another through the hyperlinks in a very unstructured way.  Other sites, such as the My Griffith website are built around a central home page which that encourages you to follow a hierarchical path when navigating to the topic you're looking for.  In the latter example, a certain topic must be navigated to in a prescribed way, whereas with the Wikipedia example, you may find a particular topic linked to from an unlikely source.

If we then apply this idea to thought, to incorporate the Rhizome into our thoughts is to open ourselves to jumping around from one thought to another and following a less prescribed thought process.  It is jumping from mind maps to seemingly random connected thoughts.

Because a rhizome is "always in the middle"[^RhizomeFirstVideo], they allow us to think dynamically and free us of the ideas of hierarchy and logical structure.

## Practices

During class, the video was paused a number of times to allow consideration of a series of questions.  These are as follows:

_Q. Who is the ‘author’ of your video?_  
A. We are the creator, but the reality is that (as per Roland Bathes), the viewer will create a story in their head based upon the film we show them - in that case, the viewer is the author of their experience.  This story will be influenced by their background and views - left/right wing, age, etc.

We can influence this by bringing meaning, nto just a narrative.  Establish character - use semiotics, person, place, culture (and subculture) to create the meaning, constantly aware of how the viewer might interpret these meanings that are created.  Establish location through the use of wide/mid/close framing of the shot.  Establish motivation.


_Q. Who is the character you need to establish in your video?_  
A. We need our viewers to identify with the questions as if they have the power to make change themselves.  We're providing a solution that empowers people to change their behaviour for the better.  For this reason, we need to establish the viewer as the character, or at least establish a character that the viewer can relate to.

_Q. What is the location to establish in your video?_  
A. As per the brief, we are targeting local with this product, however this is a system that we would like to see standardised across Australia with each council tailoring it to their capabilities and branding.  The location in the video is "your backyard" - everybody needs to relate to the problem that we're creating and although places like minesites or our waterways might be depicted in the video, they need to be presented as part of our community so as to link them to "your backyard".

_Q. What is the worldview to establish in your video?_  
A. This is a world view that is conscious of the effect we're having on the planet and willing to change our habits to create a more positive change.

_Q. Which of the three sounds is ‘your concept’?_  
A. If we describe the 3 soundscapes depicted in the video as sad / hopeful / disaster (in that order),  then we choose hopeful as the sound for our concept

_Q. What is the right sound for your approach?_  
A. Our video intends to show the negative and move to a positive facilitated by the solution we're providing.  For this reason, we're planning somber music to start with, progressing to happy, motivational vibes once the solution has been presented and the more positive outcome is shown.

_Q. How could your visual ecology as parts/scenes in your video create a whole intention?_  
A. The Visual Ecology is the colours / composition (symmetrical / asymmetrical - tension) and so on.  For this video, we're likely to reduce the image saturation in the early (negative story) parts of the film with more staurated and vibrant imagery towards the later aspects (positive solution).

_Q. How does the discussion on rhizomatic thinking in film making fit well with systemic design thinking we have already covered in the class?_  
A. Rhizomatic thinking is non-structured and doesn't rely on a hierarchical framework.  The problems we're trying to solve in Design Lab are regarded as "Wicked Problems" that are said to be "Messy".  Rhizomatic thinking resonates with this kind of problem.

_Q. What kind of light and shadow is there to consider in your filming?_  
A. Again, the earlier images will be more dark and moody, and the later iamges bringht and colourful.

_Q. How long might each clip in your timelines be (hint 4-6 secs)?_  
A. 4-6 seconds.  It looks like we will mananage with a lot of found content rather than need to shoot new footage.  Some frames may also be straight text to make a real impact - particularly those that ponder a question.

_Q. How might you write a synopsis?_  
A. Why do we continue to destroy lives and destroy the planet to extract resources when we already have them and are simply disposing of them instead of recycling them?

_Q. In order of the audience viewing the film, what is your  
    1. CATALYST  
    2. MIDPOINT  
    3. B-STORY  
    4. RESOLVE_  
A. Our product will be the _catalyst_, presented at the _midpoint_ to switch up the genre from doom and gloom of wasteful resource usage to the world of efficient recycling.  The _resolve_ and _B-story_ is the outcome of less virgin resources being squandered (and hence less damage to the planet), and more waste being recycled.

_Q. What is your shot list?  
    1. Their SCENE  
    2. Their SHOTS  
    3. Their AUDIO_  
A. See storyboards and shot list below...

_Q. Who in your team is going to do what roles (camera operator, art director, video editor, sound designer)?_  
A. At this stage, we're not anticipating too many if any new footage be created (except the operating of the app). For that reason the camera operator will be any one of us.  We have established a video coordinator who will take on the roles of art director, video editor and sound designer.  We are also fairly collaborative, so will all likely pitch in as required.


### Storyboards and shot list

Basic concept - why do we continue to destroy lives and destroy the planet to extract resources when we already have them and are simply disposing of them instead of recycling them?

Number | Narrative | Imagery | Audio
---|---|---|---
1 | Mining | Show minesite - big hole in the ground, arid | desolate sound
2 | It destroys landscapes | continue with desolation shots |
3 | And takes advantage of those less fortunate | show south american communities destroyed by recent floods | 
4 | We do this so that we can make the products we use every day | modern products |
5 | And what do we do with these raw materials when we’re done with them? | | 
6 | We put them here | landfill |
7 | But what if we didn’t have to dig up the earth to get these raw materials? | | 
8 | What if, instead of killing orangutans to grow palm oil for our bio-plastics, | land clearing |
9 | we just re-use the plastic we already have? | waste plastic | 
10 | Why do we consider plastic… and everything we throw out as waste, when in fact it’s a resource - one that’s been extracted from our earth. | continue showing recyclable products | music starting to liven up
11 | We can… we can recycle. | recycling plant |
12 | But, plastics are confusing. | person with 2 things that may or may not be recyclable (coffee cup, soft plastic packaging) |
13 | Nobody knows weather we can or can’t recycle things | |
14 | On top of that, we’ve got advanced in our manufacturing techniques and done things like line cardboard cups with plastic that need special processes to recycle, so nobody knows weather their local recycling facilities are able to deal with something as simple as a coffee cup or not.  Some do, some don’t.  
15 | Then there’s the added fear that if you contaminate a load with your ambiguous cup, you’re risking the rest of the potentially useful recyclables in that load. | recycling truck | 
16 | We need help.  We need a way of knowing what goes where when we’re done with it. | help imagery (ambulance cross?) |
17 |And there is help - lots of it, coming from us in all different directions | show war on waste, existing stickers, coffee cup recycling tubes, etc |
18 | pause to separate story from solution | | music becomes more positive
19 | We’ve built a single coherent system that will encompass all of these messages and bring them together as one definitive information source. | imagery form our products | enthusiastic music
... | This continues to explain our product, then goes on to establish a more positive future that is the result of the actions we take today | |


## Tools 
Salvador gave us quite a few tools and techniques for helping to convey a message through film.  Some things to think about when determining what to produce include:

+ Record sound separately with a portable microphone closer to your subject.  Mix the audio in to the film during the editing phase.  This makes for much more understandable audio.
+ Make sure there's lots of light
+ For a punchy 2-minute video, clips should be around 4-6 seconds each, but record at least 10 seconds for each clip and cut them back to suit in editing.
+ Use wide zoom level to establish the scene and create an understanding of place and scenario
+ Use a mid cut to help establish the character
+ Use a close up for developing the emotion
+ Use a moving object in the foreground to cut between zoom levels
+ Consider dynamic composition
    + Wide shot with lots of space provides a sense of wonder or freedom
    + Busy composition provides a sense of tension
+ Use sound wisely - it can influence the entire feel of the film
+ Cut the last 30 seconds or so off the end of a song to end on a music platform

Some tips given on how to tell a narrative:

+ Start with a synopsis
+ Conflict and resolution
+ Ebbs and flows
+ Allow viewer to breath and reflect
    + 5-10 seconds of silence to help
+ Need a catalayst
+ Around about the midpoint, provide a call to action (sense of hope)
+ Provide a B-story - how people’s lives are affected
+ Finally, resolve the conflict 
    + Dont need to fix the problem, just a way to channel the energy toward a solution


## Key Readings

There was no specific readings for this week, however I did track down and go through the original english translation of the "Death of the Author" essay.  In many ways, I agree with the outcome of this essay - we all are the product of our experiences, and the way we interpret anything is going to be influenced by those experiences.  It is true that in order to understand a creative work, we often look to the creator to try to understand their motives and background.  In this way we attempt to understand the **intended meaning** of the piece.  This is really a conscious choice on the part of the observer - one can approach a creative piece and choose to understand it in the way it affects them and the way they interpret it, or they can search for the intended meaning of the creator of that piece.

Either way, as creators, we should always consider that what we produce can be consumed by a variety of people and each will apply their own understanding from their own life experiences.  This may result in observers understanding the piece in a different way to how it was intended.  We should ensure that we don't make broad assumptions about our audience and if the understanding of a message is important, we should be explicit in delivering it's meaning.

The flipside is that we can use the audience's pre-concieved ideas to our advantage by playing on stereotypes and setting scenes that we know will generate a feeling or an understanding.  This of course relies on a general knowledge of the intended audience and that they will pick up on these cues.


## Other thoughts

I recently went to a presentation from an Australian Photographer, Keren Dobia.  During the presentation Keren talked about the national Australian Institute of Professional Photography ([AIPP](https://www.aipp.com.au)) and the fact that the judging is "blind" - meaning that the images are not labelled with the author's name.  In this way, it leaves the image to be deciphered and the meaning "authored" by the viewer, an example of a physical implementation of the idea of separation of author and content discussed in Roland Barthes theories.
