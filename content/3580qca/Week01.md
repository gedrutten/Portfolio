## Theories
#### Introduction Video
In this video, we learnt a lot about Tristan Schultz and his design practice, [Relative Creative](https://relativecreative.com.au).  This subject _is_ called Design Lab Practice, so perhaps Tristan intends to use his design practice as a case study throughout the course.  Design labs were framed as a key tool in recognising and resolving wicked problems, not necessarily through fixing the problems themselves, but through providing facilitation and tools that assist with creating effective solutions.

There was also a great video from ARUP that formed part of this introductory video.  ARUP presented a solid case for why we need to think big to solve some of the world's wicked problems.

A couple of quotes from this video that particularly resonated with me:

> "How can we decouple growth from the negative impacts of human activity"

> "Stop.  And think about the future we're each creating every day through our actions or inaction"

The video outlines the massive changes happening to the planet in terms of population growth and capital growth and the inequity that is happening as a result of the imbalance between these.  It talks of the impacts of what we do on the climate of the planet and ponders the potential for food shortages in the future.  ARUP proposes that technology holds the keys to the solution to these problems, but also the need for humanity to step in and take responsibility.  Our actions today shape the future of tomorrow.

We were introduced to the Design Lab Matrix that places various design labs from around the world onto a matrix of Linear to Systemic Design Practices vs Individual to Co-design Paradigms.  Within each of these, they were separated into design labs that focus on "Service", "Social" and "Transition".  Colour badges on the lower left of each example design lab provide further categorisation of the content - the key to the colour badges is at the top of the matrix.

A second matrix was presented that used the same axis and groupings, but displayed design tools rather than design labs.  This should be useful in finding appropriate design tools to use for certain circumstances.

## Tools 
{{< figure src="/img/3580qca/CircularDesignGuide-BuildingTeams.jpg" caption="Screenshot from the Circular Design Guide website (https://www.circulardesignguide.com/post/build-teams)" link="https://www.circulardesignguide.com/post/build-teams" >}}

The Circular Design Guide website encourages us to think about constructing teams that are multi-disciplinary so that each member of the team can look at the problem with a different set of expertise and perspective.  This allows the collective to be much more effective than the individual.

One phrase in particular I latched onto from this website was the term: _Creative Friction_.
It is stated that this is, "a key element to creating new ways of doing things".  Neither this website, nor either of it's founder's websites ([IDEO](http://www.ideo.com/) or the [Ellen MacArthur Foundation] (http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/)) go into any more detail about this term, however I did find an article entitled "[How Creative Friction can help your team](https://scottberkun.com/2018/how-creative-abrasion-helps-good-ideas/)" by Scott Berkun that explores the term.  Scott looks at how to facilitate creative friction in the team through mixing divergent people in much the same way the Circular Design Guide encourages multi-disciplinary teams.  He also suggests identifying false constraints that are restricting thought and reframing problems such that we look at them in a different way.  These are both scenarios that are likely from a group of people with diverse backgrounds as each would frame a situation based on their own life experiences.  In relation to practicing Creative Friction, he does point out that care must be taken to prevent these activities from becoming destructive and he suggests that the friction is _"something interesting and that raises curiosity, rather than feeling like a penalty"_.  By pushing back (providing creative friction) in a way that encourages curiosity, the idea is not squashed, but instead is questioned in such a way that either strengthens the idea or serves to spawn an alternate course.

In fact, we can relate this idea to our own lives, constantly exposing ourselves to people of different backgrounds or knowledge, engaging in conversation and learning from their experience and perspective.  This will help strengthen our ability to solve problems in a disruptive and potentially ingenious way, but will also help to ground us as human beings as we start to see the world from different perspectives and cultures.


The Team Building site also highlights the need to identify key roles and to outline responsibilities in order to achieve success in creating effective teams.

We created a team consisting of members from different majors:

+ Emma Kohnke - Visualisation and Immersive Design
+ Perri Wolf - Visualisation and Immersive Design
+ Brenton Martin - Graphic and Communication Design
+ Daniel Wedmaier - Interior Design and Environments
+ Myself - Product and 3D Design

We've all had at least some time between high school and university that has also given us a broader view of life and a varied set of backgrounds.  In chatting, we discovered that we each have strengths that will complement each other and clear roles began to emerge.  Since Griffith has moved to the Microsoft Office platform, we chose to use this as our base for sharing files.  We also chose to use WhatsApp as a messaging platform since it is cross-platform and the majority of the team already had accounts with it.

Although we haven't figured out what we want to target for our proposal, of the 5 categories, we feel Conscious Consumption is the category we're most passionate about.
