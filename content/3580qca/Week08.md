## Lecture Reflections
### Tristan Schultz on Designs Role in Social Enterprise
Yet another dubious crossover of Tristan's company and his teachings.  Very unprofessional camera work @ 4:00

Social Innovation, social enterprise and strategic design very similar - focussing on social practical needs for the now.


Autonomy - related to democracy and the threat to democracy - how much autonomy do we really have?

Colaboration - if we're not collaborating, we're still using a hierarchical model (top-down) which fails to involve the people being affected.

Speculative design - for the longer term
Design Futures - also longer term
