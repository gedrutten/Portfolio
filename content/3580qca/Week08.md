## Theories


From the lecture, it was explained that Social Innovation, social enterprise and strategic design very similar - they all focus on social practical needs for the now.

Autonomy - related to democracy and the threat to democracy - how much autonomy do we really have?

Collaboration - if we're not collaborating, we're still using a hierarchical model (top-down) which fails to involve the people being affected.

Speculative design - for the longer term.  Similar in that respect to Design Futures.

## Practices

According to the handbook, using the colour codes as a guide, the following studios are all aligned with social innovation, enterprise and speculative design.

The Models of Impact toolkit we worked with was created by the verynice design firm.  They create several other toolkits as well as offer facilitation services.  Their belief is that social entrepreneurship is often too late, so they promote pre-emtive responses to social need instead of waiting for a need before acting.


A couple of other initiatives they've created:

+ [How to Give Half of Your Work Away for Free](http://givehalf.co) - a book and web presence that promotes the idea of 50% pro-bono work.
+ [Peculiar Prompts](https://gumroad.com/l/peculiar) - a set of 365 prompts to stimulate ideas around exploring, making, thinking and writing.



## Tools 

We worked with the [Models Of Impact](http://www.modelsofimpact.co/) Game (from Very Nice design studio) to help us explore the potential sustainable business models that are available around recycling.  For a business to be sustainable, it requires a strong impact model _as well_ as a strong revenue model.  This game can help discover the models required to create a sustainable business that has positive impact and the resources to sustain itself.

The game happens in 4 steps:

1. **Learn**: by going through a library of "Revenue Models" and "Impact Models" a selection of 20 appropriate items from each list is generated.  A third list of self-generated "Other factors" of 20 is also created.
2. **Invent**: By using a dice to pick one item from each list, create a product/service/initiative/program with the chosen items.  Repeat with 2 items from each list, and again with 3 from each list.
3. **Program**: Use the Models of Impact canvas to refine the best idea from the Invent phase.
4. **Report**: Present the refined idea to someone else.

It is recommended that this game will take 2-3 hours, which we didn't have, so we didn't complete the process, but we did get a start.  As a group we each went through the different lists, proposing and debating various models that we though appropriate until we got 20 of each.  We didn't have a dice, so we just googled "random number between 1 and 20" to emulate the roll of a 20-sided dice.

This gave us 16, 12 and 6: _Cost Cutting_ and _Responsible Sourcing_ with _Perception_ as another factor to incorporate.

Unfortunately we didn't have time in class to take this any further, but Looking into the definition of each of the models:

    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">

        {{< figure src="/img/3580qca/MOI_2.jpg" >}}
    </div>

<br>
Perception fits well with Responsible Sourcing, but how to factor in Cost Cutting as a revenue model is a bit harder!  The idea would be to come up with a product/service/initiative/program that is influenced by these 3 factors.


## Key Readings

### Autonomy, collaboration and light communities. Lessons learnt from social innovation

[link to annotated pdf](/img/3580qca/readings/wk8_Autonomy_collaboration_and_light_communities_Lessons_learnt_from_social_innovation.pdf)

When looking at the title of this reading, "Autonomy, collaboration...", I wondered if there was a contradiction.  How could collaboration and autonomy co-exist?  In my mind autonomy is an independent attribute, whereas collaboration can only exist in a group environment.  In addressing the terms of autonomy for this discussion, Manzini points out that as a society, we're heading for one of 2 disastrous outcomes:

1. Connected loneliness, living within filter bubbles
2. Communities built on fear and hate

Both of these will be destructive to society and to equality.

The subject of autonomy though in this discussion is in fact community, or collective individuals within it.  As such, he looks at co-operative systems in place already; people sharing houses, carpooling, co-op purchasing, community gardens, etc. and the structures and behaviours within these systems.  He finds that the collective is a product of the individuals, which seems logical. 

Looking at the success of these autonomous collectives, he noted that the types and ways in which people contribute is important.  People within the community also need autonomy.  They need to be involved the way that best suits them - that may be in relation to the amount of time they can contribute, or it might be related to the skillsets they bring (or want to bring).  If these conditions aren't met, a level of tension might arise and the success of the community is risked.

He also notes that autonomous collaborations should have attributes of 'lightness'.  The definition of lightness is discussed, and to me, lightness means simple, but effective - stripping back the unnecessary such that the 'system' or 'tool' gets out of the way and allows the work to be done.

### Models of Impact Toolkit

[link to annotated pdf](/img/3580qca/readings/wk8_Models_of_Impact_toolkit.pdf)

As discussed earlier in the tools section, this is a system that gives participants a step-by-step way of developing potentially new business models with social conscience.  It gives examples of impact models and revenue models and allows the random combination of these to inspire thought around what might become of such a combination.

When participating in this game, I started to discover unthought of models in both the impact side of things and in the revenue side.  Even just going through the glossary sparked ideas of ways we could fund our project, or other elements we could add to give greater impact.  It is true that by ourselves we can come up with something pretty good, but by leveraging this glossary, and learning about different models in the process, we can build something more robust and probably more sustainable.
