## Theories

[decolonisingdesign.com](http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/) addresses colonisation and the problematic issues it presents in the following few paragraphs from their [editorial](http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/)...

> These issues are products of modernity and its ideologies, regimes, and institutions reiterating, producing and exerting continued colonial power upon the lives of oppressed, marginalized, and subaltern peoples in both the ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ world. This planet, **shared and co-inhabited by a plurality of peoples**, each inhabiting different worlds, each orienting themselves within and towards their environments in different ways, and with different civilizational histories, **is being undermined by a globalized system of power that threatens to flatten and eradicate ontological and epistemological difference, rewriting histories and advance visions of a future for a privileged few** at the expense of their human and nonhuman others.

> To date, **mainstream design discourse** has been dominated by a **focus on Anglocentric/Eurocentric ways of seeing**, knowing, and acting in the world, with little attention being paid to alternative and marginalized discourses from the non Anglo-European sphere, or the nature and consequences of design-as-politics today. This narrowness of horizons and deficiency in criticality is a reflection of the limitations of the institutions within which design is studied and practiced, as well as of the larger socio-political systems that design is institutionally integrated into.

> We believe that a sharper lens needs to be brought to bear on **non-western ways of thinking and being**, and on the way that class, gender, race, etc,. issues are designed today. We understand the highlighting of these issues through practices and acts of design, and the (re)design of institutions, design practices and design studies (efforts that always occur under conditions of contested political interests) to be a pivotal challenge in the process of decolonisation. We also want to move beyond academic discourse to critique and think around the ideas and practices that circulate through the work of professional designers embedded in the various sectors of production that stimulate and sustain the modern/colonial world economy. [^DecolEd]

From this, I understand decolonisation to be the recognition and acceptance that we are dominated by anglo/euro centric thinking at the expense of a rich history of alternate thinking that has been oppressed over the last several centuries.  Quijano describes how colonisation came to be - the suppression of incumbent thought, through to the trickle feed of colonial ideas, and ultimately the seduction of power promised by western ways to elicit adoption to these ways of thinking.

In the lecture, Tristan highlighted the fact that the oppressed peoples (indigenous, subaltern, marginalised, "global south") actually make up around 80% of the population, yet are dominated and controlled by the political structures of the first world, colonial systems.  This pattern continues into the global design discourse (at least in terms of what we're exposed to).

The editorial goes on to describe their goals in line with decolonisation...

> Our objective—as design scholars and practitioners—is to transform the very terms of present day design studies and research. Designers can put to task their skills, techniques, and mentalities to designing futures aimed at advancing ecological, social, and technological conditions where multiple worlds and knowledges, involving both humans and nonhumans, can flourish in mutually enhancing ways. For us, decolonisation is not simply one more option or approach among others within design discourse. Rather, it is a fundamental imperative to which all design endeavors must be oriented.

Decolonial thinkers are wondering how to de-link from the colonial matrix of power - this is decolonisation.  The goal is to create plural futures that embrace the previous knowledge of the oppressed nations and peoples.  Mignolo sees a future of polycentric world order where ruling itself is fragmented.  

However, decolonisation isn't just about de-linking from the western ways of thought.  It is also about making re-connections to pasts that may have been destroyed or concealed by colonisation.  

In terms of our immediate works, we need to consider that we are not contributing to the oppression of non-western culture, instead embracing, incorporating, or at the very least recognising the existence of a broader set of thought.

Is decolonisation also the embrace of alternate religions and idealogies?

#### Questions from the lecture

_Q. What does the endeavor of decolonising design mean?_  
A. Removing rigid thought patterns in the design discourse that suppress or overlook minorities or non-western thinking and bringing into the conversation the ideas that these forgotten cultures or idealogies have had concealed or denied.  As a result, we will become richer as we seek ways of thinking that we've not necessarily been exposed to in western design thought.

_Q. Discuss any informal or formal ideas and practices of decolonising design that you've noticed emerging?_  
A. The obvious one of course would be Relative Creative's work in incorporating indigenous mapping styles in the tools provided earlier in this subject.  
Another might be agricultural systems such as permaculture which incorporate lessons learnt from indigenous farming techniques.  New Zealand seem to be quite respectful of the native culture there to and incorporate Mauri ideas in various part of their predominantly western culture.


## Practices

Relative Creative obviously lean heavily on the first peoples heritage of Tristan Schultz.  It is apparent that through the work that they do at Relative Creative, the embracing of indigenous ideas and culture is first and foremost, and brings a richness to the possibilities that these different ways of thinking afford.

Decolonisingdesign.com is also a good example of a group of designers working to ensure that the discourse around the term decolonising design is not lost or diluted, but remains true to it's original intent.  The site also serves as a great tool for conversations around decolonising design.
