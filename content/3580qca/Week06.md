This paper introduces the idea of using gameplay to help people visualise potential futures.  They recognise that this is not the solution to the worlds great problems as they stand, but is certainly an entertaining and thought-provoking conversation starter.  And in a world in which we are bound by the political stalemate that results in incremental as opposed to grand scale change, thinking about largely different futures is not part of common discussion.

The cards serve to prompt a vision for the future.  The card game asks a player to extract a card from each suit to form a "creative prompt".  From this, a future scenario is imagined and articulated.


The original game contained 4 suits:

> _Arc_ is the applicable time horizon and type of future, building on Jim Dator’s four generic futures (sometimes also called archetypes) framework (Dator, 2009a). _Terrain_ is the context for the object, either a physical location or a domain of human activity. The _Object_ is the category of hypothetical ‘future thing’ for which players will generate a description (not always a physical artefact), ranging from Device, to Headline, to Monument. Finally, _Mood_ says how it feels to interact with that thing, lending an ‘interior’ inflection to the other three more ‘external’ elements.1

Later the game evolved to just 3 suits but included phrases on the cards to help arrange and postulate the prompt.

I think this is a great idea and I can see it being very powerful in a workshop environment.  The paper goes on to explain why the game is effective and points to a couple of reasons in particular:

+ We are trained to literally _deal with the cards we're dealt_, so we will work with the phrase presented to us
+ This is a form or reverse-archeology:  Archeology looks to artefacts of the past to describe an unknown past, whereas this game uses an artefact of a potential future to help us postulate what might be.
+ it is a card game - it is intended to be playful
