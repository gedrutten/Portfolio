## Theories

The idea put forward by Capra[^Capra] that we are entering a time where we come to realise that we should be considering the world to be a series of interconnected relationships rather than a machine seems to make sense.  Historically, design has been associated with creating "things" or tangible artefacts in isolation.  These can be relatively easily understood in terms of complexity by a single person or a team.  However as we tackle these big problems, these "wicked" problems that are large and intricate socio-technical systems, we come to realise that it's not a simple machine with a workshop manual that describes how everything fits together in a nice neat package.  It is in fact a complex system that can't be entirely described, but can be understood in terms of the dynamic relationships between the interconnected parts. 

_Q. What are the implications of principles such as self-organisation and emergence for designers?_  
A. Implications are that by observing emergence and self-organisation, we can design better for the people that actually use them (feedback loop).  Taking the pathways example: if we observe that people are walking on a different path to the designed pathways, we put the new pathways where people are walking since that’s where they want to walk.  By doing this, we recognise the emergent pattern and respond.


_Q. How, in framing design problems within tight contexts, do we ‘deny’ the complexity of the system we are designing in and for?_  
A. By restricting design to a tight context, you implicitly ignore something else.  We don't necessarily even know the full extent of the context - it may reveal itself as part of the design process.  If we frame a problem to a specific context, we may rule out, or just not even see a context that may be far more effective at resolving the actual problem.  

Somebody once said that if Henry Ford made what people wanted, then he would have given them a faster horse.  By restricting the context of road transport to the traditional horse-and-cart solution of the day, the "better" solution of the automobile would never have been discovered (although some might disagree with this given the future that has been created as a result).

_Q. Can you think of ways that the inherent dynamics within complex systems can be leveraged in design solutions?_  
A. Observe the connectedness - their relationships.  Since complex systems exist as a set of relationships, these can be focussed on to provide a solution.  Feedback can also be leveraged by letting the designer know if they are on the right track, or if the inputs they are providing are deviating from the desired course.

        This is a course offered by Carnegie Mellon focussing on Transition Design.  Some of the key readings from this week come from the same authors, and the other readings are resources for this course.  
        </br></br>
        As can be seen, they structure the course around 4 areas of knowledge: Visions for transition, Theories of change, Posture and Mindset, and New ways of designing.

## Key Readings

### The Systems View on Life (Fritjof Capra)[^Capra]
[link to annotated pdf](/img/3580qca/readings/wk4_The_Systems_View_of_Life.pdf)

This journal article looks at the departure of thinking from dualist nature to one of systemic thinking.

> At the core of this new understanding we find a fundamental change of metaphors: from seeing the world as a machine to understanding it as a network. (p242[^Capra])

> The entire material world, ultimately, is a network of inseparable patterns of relationships. (p242[^Capra])

> Evolution is no longer seen as a competitive struggle for existence, but rather as a cooperative dance in which creativity and the constant emergence of novelty are the driving forces. (p243[^Capra])

Ultimately, the 3 above quotes from the first 2 pages of this journal article change the way we think of the world from something of relatively independent beings operating solo to a world of interconnected beings cooperating, not something, to evolve.

Later, Capra argues that the cognitive sciences describe a mind that is not a thing, but a process - a network of self-generating and self-organising network of components.  He continues to look at biology to develop the thought of the network.

In the closing pages of the article, Capra brings the discussion from the (quite interesting) biological context to the social context.

> ...the critical importance of the systems view for dealing with the problems of our multi-faceted global crisis. It is now becoming more and more evident that the major problems of our time — energy, environment, climate change, poverty, and so on — cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are all interconnected and interdependent.

All things are connected and can't be tacked effectively in isolation, or to do so is to ignore the effects of our actions on the other parts of the system.  For example, if we produce more energy, we may impact other systems such as biodiversity, health or climate.  Introducing a cane toad to solve one problem might create another problem.  Providing new shoes to developing nations may deprive the local shoe repair industry and cause poverty issues greater than the original issues of the need for shoes.  We need to consider the complete system when we design - this is systematic thinking.


### The Role of Design and Designers in Socio-Technical Systems

This chart demonstrates and helps us conceptualise the interconnections and systemic reach of socio-technical systems.  It gives an example of all the different systems involved in Land-based Road Transportation.

### Living Systems Principles
[link to annotated pdf](/img/3580qca/readings/wk4_Living_Systems_Principles.pdf)

This paper outlines the key principles of living systems and how the biological systems apply to design.  It's interesting how so many parallels can be made between actual biological living systems and that of systemic design practice.  This paper outlines 10 key attributes that apply to both:

1. Organizationally open, self-organizing and ‘autopoetic’  
    Meaning they self-replicate, self-organise and take inputs from outside their context.  It is obvious that the human body exhibits these attributes - we've all seen the video of a single cell doubling over and over to create a baby.  Nothing external tells the cells to mae the various parts of the body, they just do it all by themselves.  
2. Operate in a state far from equilibrium  
    A system that is effected by (or requires input from) external influence is inherently unstable. 
3. Have ‘emergent’ properties  
    Like the walkways example given in class, a system will reveal solutions if you observe the emergent properties.
4. Their structure is networked, holarchic, and fractal  
    A system consists of systems within systems interconnected by relationships.  Each part is a whole in itself, but so is the sum of parts.  Designers need to see the big picture while still sweating the small stuff (and keep an eye on what it is that connects the two).
5. Are sensitive to initial conditions  
    As in climate change - the biosphere that is our earth has shown us the result of what happens when you produce greenhouse gasses en masse.  These are the initial conditions (in this case, they are continuing), and the result may be that we get a runaway rise in temperature.
6. Are controlled/regulated through feedback  
    Responding to the effect of our designs.  It makes sense that if we acknowledge that we cannot fully understand these entire problem spheres, then we need to implement ways to respond to unexpected responses (both good and bad).
7. When healthy, have high degree of diversity  
    We can't assume one-design-fits-all.
8. Comprised of non-linear relationships  
    Relationships are messy.
9. Whole and part relationships are non-hierarchical  
    What is the whole?  Are the parts a whole in themselves?  Do they exist because of the greater whole, or can they exist as part of another whole?
10. Are full of interdependence and cooperation  
    "An objective of any design brief can be to create, foster and enhance symbiotic relationships between components/members of a system." (from the document itself)


We inherently recognise that living systems are complex, and despite all the advances in science, we still don't understand the human body.  In the same way, these large socio-technical problems require a systemic design solution.
