## Theories
_Q. How would you characterise the difference between Australian society and other geographies that has enabled different formations and paradigms of design labs?_  
A. Politically, we are centrists.  Not too many socially progressive views and getting funding for this kind of venture is difficult.  Wee are isolated in Australia without land borders to another country.  This geographical isolation reduces our ability to influence internationally - it's difficult and expensive to travel to a conference here - more than a quick day-trip that is possible in European cities.  A side effect of this geographic isolation is that we live in a bubble.

As indicated in the Design Lab matrix, the Australian design labs are not great at thinking sytemically at a global scale - perhaps this geographic isolation is part of the reason for our lack in global thinking.

_Q. Where do you think is a good place, in your local sphere, to embed a Design Lab that would effectively put innovative and visionary socio-spatial contexts centre stage?_  
A. In terms of location, we thought one of the abandoned industrial buildings near the milk factory near Kurilpa park could work well as a design lab location.  By being placed there, it would act as an interface between the growing residental apartment areas and the existing cultural precinct of GOMA, state library, the Edge, museum, etc.  As the interface, it would serve the residential and could utilise the existing infrastructure of the cultural precinct (eg. The Edge and state library).

Anther suggestion made in class discussion was the old skate building on Waterworks Rd that partially burnt down in 2004.  Well located in terms of visibility, iconic building and decent commercial community (cafe’s, shops, etc.))  

_Q. What kind of combination of art, science, design, community, government, industry and institutions might be right for your design lab?_  
A. Continuing on the idea of a disused industrial space near the milk factory, this space is central to a lot of influencial organisations.  Both Griffith and QUT are close for potential university partnerships.  As mentioned earlier, being close to the cultural precinct, it would make sense to share resources - the State library already has a strong Asia Pacific Design Library and recently displayed an exhibition for the Commonwealth Games Baton design.  It also has fabrication facilities in The Edge and a small business facility that might be able to co-work with various design projects.  The library might also benefit from the relationship with the design lab through use of the dedicated design facilities.  Across the river to the west is a hub for technology companies in Milton and to the North is the CBD.


## Practices

Looking at the Design Lab Matrix again.

Where Australian design labs were scarce in the top right corner of the matrix (the culturally systemic, co-design and transitional paradigm segment), the international design labs are prominant in this sector.

Here are some international examples of design labs:

+ Superflux - focussed on futures and speculative design
+ Futera - change agency.  branding, sustainability.  Four pillars: vision, maps, stories, symbols.
+ ARUP - arguably the worlds largest design and engineering firm.  Strong sustainability approach.
+ Artefact - designing at local scales (not global)
+ Namahn - helping organisations with complexity.  Systemic, local dealing with existing socio-economic paradigms.
+ Very Nice - business centred socially engaged design.  Again, systemic, local, dealing with existing structures.




## Tools 

### Critical Mapping Tool

This tool enables us to identify Presents (1)(current scenarios), Pasts (2)(previous scenarios), Futures (4)(the future if we stay on this path), and Futures Arriving (6)(desired future) to identify the Clash (7) - the place where desired and current futures collide - the place where a difference can be made.  Below is the template (with key elements highlighted) followed by the workings of our group when we applied our project to it.

### Website: World Economic Forum Intelligence Maps - Mapping Global Transformations
https://intelligence.weforum.org

This is a great tool for looking at various global transformations and see how they interrelate.  Although neither Recycling nor Waste were represented as a transition topic, I investigated 4 related topics to look at other connections and implications: Mining and Metals, Circular Economy, Future of Consumption, and Sustainable Development.

### iPad App: ARUP Drivers of Change

Again, a great tool for understanding the details behind sustainability issues facing the world.  In this case, Waste 2.0 was listed as a topic, so I spent some time exploring the pathways and interrelationships associated with waste.

## Key Readings
### Impacts of urban living labs on sustainability transitions: mechanisms and strategies for systemic change through experimentation

[link to annotated pdf](/img/3580qca/readings/wk3_Impacts_of_urban_living_labs_on_sustainability_transitions_mechanisms_and_strategies_for_systemic_change_through_experimentation.pdf)

This reading looks at Urban Living Labs (ULL's), their design practices and their ways of effectiveness - do they effect broader system change and how?  This is done through the case study of 4 exisitng ULL's; 2 in Rotterdam, Netherlands and 2 in Malmö, Sweden.

Two of the 4 examples are built within existing iconic infrastructure, giving them a character and approachability by drawing on the history of the space in which they reside.

What this paper focussed on was how each ULL operated and how effective this way of operating is in having a impact beyond the ULL bourndaries.  They look at embedding experients in local structures as well as various types of diffusion into other areas.

> We argue that there are three ideal typical tyes of diffusion processes currently discussed in the literature: _embedding, translating_ and _scaling_.(p232[^ULL])

+ Embedding - adoption and integration of a practice into existing local structures.
+ Translation - applying a practice to another area or context (horizontal diffusion).
+ Scaling - internal growth of a concept or practice.  Can be:
    + Spatial scaling (geographic growth)
    + Content scaling (extending across domains and practices)
    + Actor scaling (different partnerships and actors)
    + Resource scaling (more funding)
    
**Blue City Lab** (Rotterdam) actually operates several facilities in house such as a bar and restaurant so that they can experiment with and typify a circular economy.

**Concept House Village Lab** (Rotterdam) experiments with sustainable building techniques and retrofitting approaches.  Being in a disused shipyard, they have the space to experiment with the  full lifecycle of building technologies.

**Malmö Innovation Platform** (Malmö) attempt to use housing renovation as a tool for socio-economic development by working with an abundance of apartment buildings built in the 1960's and 1970's.

**Stapeln Open Maker Space** (Malmö) is a maker space providing facilities to community and encouraging reuse of waste material from industry.

The outcomes show that:

+ Location and the narrative afforded by the location is important in embedding in a socio-spatial context for effecive engagement
+ Diffusion methods (embedding, translating and scaling) do not operate independantly by work together
+ Educational and training activities undertaken by the labs provide a model for replication of their activities elsewhere.
+ Scaling methods occur simultaneously and complement each other.

Another thing of note in this reading is the funding models employed by each of these ULL's.  It seems the design activities themselves do not forma sustainable business model with the ULL's generating extra revenue by renting out office space, lab space and event space.  Some also run commercial enterprises as part of tehir experimentation of systems (the commercial enterprise being a test bed).  LInks to education institutions or carrying out training courses on site also helps to fund the ULL.  Municipalities and industry may also provide funds.
