## Theories

Design practice has traditionally been associated with the structured approach to creating a tangible outcome, be it a website, marketting material, product or other "thing".  As the world begins to tackle bigger issues, design theories and tools are being leaned on to help solve these issues.  As a result, design as a practice is moving from the design studio to the design lab where design is used for a process rather than a product.

The readings for this week address the need for greater design-for-process education in our institutions to better prepare us for the increase in the need for design labs in the future as we realise that these wicked problems we are tackling are large, messy problems that require more than a quick-fix solution. 


## Practices

Looking at the Australian design labs, a lot of them are looking at isolated scale systemic design at a local level.  Very few, Relative Creative being one of them are in the Culturally Systemic (ie. global), trasitional design paradigm space.  

+ Paper Giant - strategic design consultancy they help you understand and solve complex problem, offer services, combine research, design and strategy.
+ Inkahoots - Transitional, but are designing in a relatively isolated manner.  Politically driven.
+ Future Ensemble - service design, within existing socio-economic environments / political paradigms.
+ Today - similar to Future Ensemble.  Servicing commercial clients in existing paradigms.
+ Tacsi - Service design studio.  Partner with organisations and communities, socially engaging.
+ Meld - service design studio - services, systems, experiences.
+ Desis (RMIT) - by being connected to a university, they can push the limits a little.
+ Relative Creative - transitional (at least aspirationally radical solutions)

_Q. How would you characterise the difference between a traditional approach to a design studio and the concept of design labs?_  
A. A traditional design studio was focussed on deveoping a tangible product or outcome whereas the design lab is more process based - a facilitator of multi-disciplinary contribuotrs to a bigger problem.  There is an increased focus on sustainability and experimentation, participatory approach, ethnographic research.

_Q. How are current, typical ways of being in the world problematic?  Is self-reflection and awareness of your own value set part of your design process?_  
A. We exist in this western world bubble, many of us with white priviledge.  Have to make sure that we dont allow our inherent bias to effect our design process and that we empathise with the people that will be impacted by our design.  Our values as designers is often in conflict to the values of business (we value sustainability, business values monetary gains).  In terms of the Melbourne City Lab, there is an obvious potential for bias toward the interests of the council that supports them.

_Q. Debate whether Australian 'design labs' are doing 'enough' to transition to radically new social, economic and political paradigms?_  
A. According to the matrix curated by Tristan, no, Australian design labs are not doing enough.  Many have been categorised as either operating in a bubble of sorts (non-participatory), are just not thinking big enough (systematic, but not culturally systematic), or are not pushing the bubble in terms of radically new approaches to socio-economic paradigms.  In Tristans matrix, he only identifies his own design lab as aspiring to push the boundaries.

### Define your challenge

As a group we haven't yet locked down a specific task, so we weren't able to undertake this task.  However, looking at the process, a couple of key things stand out.

The first cople of steps are straightforward; gettingt he group together and clarifying the goal.  In the third step, 4 questions need to be answered:

+ What impact do you hope to have? (set a small and achievable goal)
+ What does success look like? How will you know when you get there?
+ What’s working for you? How can you amplify these forces?
+ What’s working against you? How do you plan to address these challenges?

These are interesting prompting questions that would hep to ensure that the impact is measurable (what does success look like?).  Interestingly, this aspect of the questioning is different from the "how" - it is the "what" and it separates the outcome from the path to achieving the outcome.  This gives the process room to develop as log as the eventual outcome is still achieved.  The next couple of questions are similar to the kind of questioning you might find in a personality test - strengthen the strengths, identify and deal with the weaknesses.

Step 5 makes sure the next steps are idetified giving the team a way to move forward and a list of people to get in touch with to help achieve the teams goals.  By doing this, it eliminates the potential to be paralysed by indecision since the outcomes of this step would be a clear direction to follow.

An early narrative is also developed in step 5 which gives everybody on the team a consistent story to tell in conversation.  Its always interesting when you speak to friends about the work you're undertaking.  Quite often a seed of discussion can lead to discovering skillsets, resources or contacts that are already available in your circle of friends.  By having this narrative, these connections can be made.


## Key Readings
#### Roles of design in sustainability transitions projects: A case study of Visions and Pathways 2040 project from Australia.

In this reading, the authors observed the process, methods and outcomes from 2 workshops, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne.  The participants of these workshops came from both professional and non-professional design backgrounds.  As Manzini[^Manzini] puts it, as humans, we inherently have the ability to design - he calls this "diffuse design".  In contrast, Manzini calls professional design "expert design".

During the experiment, it was observed that the activities associated with traditional design - ie. generating an output; formed only a small part of the design activities.  A significant element of the design was in the design activities highlighted as those required in the process of Transitional Design

> Only a small portion of the roles that were explicitly observed in this exploration were related to generation of traditional forms of design outputs such as visualisations.  Majority of the roles played by design were related to injuiry and process, in how problems and potential solutions were framed and how knowledge was acquired and synthesized. (1304[^VP2040])

The paper goes on to highlight the idea that in the short term, design as a process (as in Transitional Design) will not necessarilly be financially recognised.  It is envisaged that these skills are most likely to be employed in large design consultancies and organisations that might be involved in public policy creation.

They postulate though that as society begins to recognise the role of transition design in bringing multi-disciplinary teams together to tackle larger, wicked design problems, that there will be more demand for this approach to design and that academic institutions will need to adapt to ensure a supply of designers are ready for this type of role.

## Other Activities Carried Out this Week

Since we as a group haven't locked in our topic for the design brief, we each went away and developed 3 ideas that we could propose to the group.  This is my contribution to that discussion...

### Problem 1: Supply Chain Packaging

On a recent evening visit to Coles, I was astounded by the amount of plastics used in logistical packaging of products.  Some products for instance were wrapped in plastic in packs of 3 bottles.  It is apparent that the packaging needs to conform to the Coles display shelves as the bottom packaging serves as a shelf front, yet the rest is wrapped in plastic.  I even saw boxes of 10 coke cans wrapped in plastic packs of 2 (E.g. the product was cardboard boxes of 10 cans, but they were then wrapped in sets of 2 for transport?).  As a consumer, you may choose a product because it is sold in cardboard, glass or aluminium (considering its reuse or recycle capacity), but be unaware that the product was bundled in plastic as part of the distribution channels.  I did notice that during shelf stocking (in which excess packaging and plastic was removed) plastic and cardboard waste was being stored in separate bins, so I am assuming that they would be separately recycled, however, to the best of my knowledge, plastics are rarely 100% recycled without adding virgin material, so I don’t know that this is necessarily a sustainable approach.

In saying that, I did purchase a tub of ice cream that evening and put it in my backpack for the trip home.  It subsequently leaked in my bag during transit, so perhaps plastic (or a better / reusable) substitute would have prevented this situation!

### Problem 2: Food Security
With the expanding urbanisation, more and more farming land is being pushed further from the consumer, generating greater food miles for everything we eat (bad carbon footprint).  In addition, we are becoming more and more isolated from understanding where our food comes from (potentially unhealthy, potential monopolies, potential loss of skills and increasing dependence on industry).  On top of that, a proportion of our arable land is being allocated to purposes other than for human consumption, eg. crops for livestock feed or generating biofuels, even for bioplastics and oils (palm oil).  Food security is fast becoming a significant issue for the future, yet is something that could be tackled on the local scale.

### Problem 3: Consistent Lane Markings for Personal Transport (pedestrian, cyclists, scooters, etc.)
With the increasing number of people resorting to non-vehicular transport options, consistent methods of separating different transport options to maintain efficiency and safety need to be developed and adopted.  Currently on shared pathways, there is several modes of transport being used: pedestrian (running and walking), cyclist (pedal and pedal assist), e-scooters, skateboards (again, both electric and manual), 1-wheels, segways and occasionally skates and rollerblades.  With each mode of transport comes different speeds and expectations.  Rules are unclear and markings are inconsistent leading to confusion and potentially hazardous situations.  Sometimes these pathways are shared with vehicular traffic as well (on-road bikeways), with different behavioural expectations again.  This problem is prevalent in Brisbane, but many regions are dealing with, or have already dealt with this, so there could well be studies out there that could help us adopt a particular approach.

        Inconsistent colouring and confusing markings - traditionally, bikeways have been tan coloured, however, it seems that BCC are trending towards green in newer markings.

### Problem 4a: Single use plastics
Provide a more economical and more accessible way to access byo-packaging products (such as Naked Foods and The Source).  Currently this style of shopping targets consumers that are both environmentally aware and organic food shoppers.  As a result, access for people that aren’t prepared to pay the premium for organic foods are excluded from being able to reuse containers.

### Problem 4b: Standards for reusable container tare weights
Using reusable containers when buying bulk foods means that each container has to be weighed before and after so that the actual weight of goods can be determined.  Perhaps we can come up with a way to standardise weights, or a way to dispense accurate measures so that any container can be reused.
