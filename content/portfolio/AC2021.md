Given that the AC75 Class Rules had been released earlier in the year, I decided to develop a yacht based on these design rules and create a simulated sailing game to emulate the 36th Americas Cup to be held in New Zealand in the year 2021.

All modelling was created using Autodesk Maya, textures were created in Adobe Photoshop, and the gaming engine created using Unity and Visual Studio.
