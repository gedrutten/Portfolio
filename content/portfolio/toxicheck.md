        ToxiCheck is a mobile app designed to help customers understand the chemicals our food has been exposed to.  It is powred by data gathered by FreshTest<sup>TM</sup>, an independent company testing for chemical residue on fruit and vegetables sold through Australiaâ€™s central wholesale markets.  
        </br>
        </br>
        The app allows the user to scan fresh produce to provide real time feedback to its users, warning of any residue that is likely and the possible health or environmental impacts of that residue.

        This was a group assessment.  I created a working iPhone app as part of my contribution.
