Designed for a friend that enjoys cycling holidays, this tricycle converts to a wheeled suitcase for transit.  When used as a tricycle, the suitcase rests behind the reclined cycling position.  During transit, however, the frame of the tricycle envelops the suitcase and creates a trolley for easy manipulation at airports and transit areas.

My role in this project was to model up the 2D designs created by my friend so as to test the geometry, adjust dimensions and angles and design the steering cage.  By creating a 3D model, the functions of the tricycle could be simulated and technical drawings could be provided to the fabricator.
