I began this project on my birthday with a colleague who shared our birthday and also shared a passion for photography. It was a challenging, but rewarding journey to complete the full year of taking a photo every day.  

This is the caption from my final 365 post:

>_A year ago today, I took this same photo as the first photo of my 365 project.  Part of the motivation of this project was to explore photography a little more by incorporating it into every day.  Another motivation was to find something each day to appreciate and visually document.  Some days it was hard to cull down the photos to just one and other days I'd struggle for a single image, but every day a photo was posted.  Now that the project is complete, it's interesting to look back through the images and reflect on the visual diary it describes._
